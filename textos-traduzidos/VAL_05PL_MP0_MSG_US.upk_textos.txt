Welcome to Caf√© Moondust.
Hey there, didja know? There's a city even past the<03e0>great desert.<04e0>At the southern tip of the world, sitting at the base<03e0>of Mt. Altona is a town of hardy<07f0>if pigheaded<07f0>miners.
What, you want to know what's in the western desert?<04e0>The old adventurers used to say that west of the west<03e0>was a forgotten town. But no one knows if it's true or<03e0>not<07f0>no one's ever come back from there alive.<04e0>Mmm, I wouldn't waste my time worrying about that<03e0>place. I would never allow my daughter to go there,<03e0>either!
Every time I see Zolean in here, he's drinking alone.<03e0>It's weird, because he was in here with the same friend<03e0>for years. Wonder what happened to the other guy?
What is it, son? Are you thinking you want to cross<03e0>the desert?<04e0>The Great Sand Sea's home to monsters you won't find<03e0>anywhere else in the world<07f0>and the rest of the world<03e0>is all the luckier for it!<04e0>If you've really got your heart set on going out there,<03e0>make sure you're amply prepared.
What's the critter sitting outside? That's my<03e0>partner, of course!<04e0>Traveling merchants like us make our way by<03e0>takin' a wide range of goods back and forth<03e0>across the desert.<04e0>It's a harsh trip, but with my faithful companion<03e0>by my side, the journey ain't so bad.<04e0>Whoa, there, pardner, hold yer horses. No<03e0>matter how much you offer, I ain't about to let<03e0>my faithful steed go!
Hey, pardner, didja hear?<04e0>The boss o' this here country's been sick fer a<03e0>long spell, an' ain't any o' the medicines<03e0>helpin' a lick.<04e0>While on the range, I rode into another country,<03e0>an' they were singin' a similar song.<04e0>Reckon this bug is only hittin' royal-types?<03e0>That sure don't sound too likely, though...
...<04e0>.........<04e0>What? Don'tcha know when ta leave a cowpoke<03e0>alone? ...Though I reckon there ain't no more<03e0>use in avoidin' it...<04e0>E'er since the Tao Tie disappeared, Balterossa's<03e0>become a ghost town. The dealers ain't comin'<03e0>through, and my business's gone to the dogs.<04e0>To square old debts, I even had to sell my<03e0>faithful companion...<04e0>*sniffle* If...if I could just see 'im again,<03e0>make sure he's bein' treated right...!
Lots of girls are huge fans of Lady Charlotte.<03e0>The minute she's seen wearing anything,<03e0>similar fashions start flying off store shelves.<04e0>In a word, she's like the town's idol.<04e0>*sigh* I'm jealous...I wish everyone would try<03e0>and emulate me!
Did you hear the latest about Lady Charlotte?<04e0>Apparently she broke up with her boyfriend!<03e0>It's the absolute latest news.<04e0>And when you hear who it was, you're going to<03e0>flip. It was the son of Royotia's Marquis, Paris!<04e0>I mean, seriously, that man is fine. And you<03e0>know he's gotta be a passionate and skilled<03e0>lover.<04e0>*sigh* If it were me, there'd be no way I'd let<03e0>a catch like that go!
Have you heard the latest about Lady Charlotte?<04e0>Apparently she got back together with her<03e0>boyfriend, Paris. I guess she rethought letting<03e0>such a hunk get away.<04e0>Oh, and get this<07f0>their feelings for each other<03e0>were so strong that they were able to keep us<03e0>and Royotia from going to war!<04e0>*sigh* I want to hook up with a sensitive<03e0>hottie like that...
A thousand years ago, there was a prosperous<03e0>country in the middle of the desert. The guard<03e0>that protected it was unmatched in skill.<04e0>That strength threatened the Imperator, and he<03e0>set his armies against them. When the dust<03e0>cleared, the desert country was destroyed.<04e0>However...the spirits of the warriors from the<03e0>defeated land still lurk within the desert's<03e0>sands, awaiting the perfect time for revenge...<04e0>My great-grandfather first told me that tale<03e0>when I was just a little boy. Man, was I spooked!<03e0>I was always home by dark after that!<04e0>Even now, I don't like to go to the<03e0>bathroom alone... Eheheh.
I really worry for Lady Bertrude... She is deathly<03e0>ill, and getting worse every day.<04e0>For her to go from standing proudly at the head<03e0>of our country to lying in a sickbed... How could<03e0>this happen?<04e0>Or<07f0>could it be...?<04e0>The curse of the felled warriors of the ancient<03e0>desert kingdom...?<04e0>Is it possible there was truth to that story...?<03e0>...Ugh, I don't want to think about it!
A half-year previous, a legion of monsters<03e0>attacked the city. Never in all my years had I<03e0>seen so many beasts at once...<04e0>A Silver Falcon said the monsters had come<03e0>from deep in the desert, where a certain beast<03e0>was summoning them as part of a curse.<04e0>It could call unlimited reinforcements, so the<03e0>battle would be unimaginably fierce.<04e0>Without a doubt, this must be the work of the<03e0>angry spirits left from the ancient kingdom of<03e0>the desert...<04e0>Awaking in this time, they seek revenge by<03e0>sending monsters against the lands of the God<03e0>Emperor...<04e0>Goodness gracious, to think that the legend of<03e0>the Kingdom of Glenys was true...
The Silver Falcons have sworn to protect order<03e0>across the continent. We act without regard for<03e0>borders<07f0>there is only one world, after all.<04e0>We are currently in the middle of an important<03e0>strategy session. Please don't interrupt.
Oh, you again.<03e0>Heard about you from the commander.<04e0>Granted, you don't look like much, but I hear<03e0>you're not too shabby with a sword.<04e0>Next time we have an anti-monster operation,<03e0>join us. Lately, we need all the help we can get.
Hi, Rush!<03e0>Sorry for being so rude before.<04e0>I heard the commander was so impressed by<03e0>you that he decided to join you on your journey.<04e0>All of us Falcons have taken an oath to the<03e0>organization, to protect it and uphold what it<03e0>stands for.<04e0>Tell Commander Caedmon that he doesn't have<03e0>to worry about us! The Falcons will still be here<03e0>when he comes back.
These two twin girls came by earlier, and the<03e0>white-haired one left this key. I don't have<03e0>any use for it, so if you want it, it's yours.
Oh, it's you.<03e0>A space away from the heat and hustle and bustle<03e0>of outside... I like this place.
Ah, you...<04e0>I feel like I've forgotten something important yet again...<03e0>Or perhaps it's just my imagination...
I feel like I've forgotten something very important...<03e0>But perhaps it's just my imagination...
Of late the vision of a strange woman has been<03e0>coming to me...<04e0>A girl with a mischievous smile and long, graceful<03e0>fingers... She draws near and strokes my cheek, and...<04e0>Hahaha... Perhaps the desert heat is going to my head.<04e0>Men who spend all their time at war have no time<03e0>for exploits of a romantic nature, yes?
Of late I've been struck with memories of a woman<03e0>I don't know. Odd...a man who spends his days<03e0>fighting as I do has no time for romance...
Oh, Rush.<03e0>I think I've been able to remember more, vaguely...<04e0>We were together...I and that woman...<03e0>She was brilliant<07f0>bright, uncompromising...<03e0>As intense as the desert sun.<04e0>We were sitting near the water...<03e0>The reflection of her smile sparkled off the surface<03e0>of the river.<04e0>...River? Or perhaps it was a canal?<03e0>Where could all of this have happened?<03e0>Curses, I remember all but the most crucial parts...
Who was that woman?<03e0>Damn, I cannot recall anything...<03e0>I think it was near a canal, but...
Hello, Rush.<03e0>I've decided.<03e0>I'm going to find that woman.<04e0>I haven't regained all of my memories of her, but<03e0>I cannot help but think I must meet with her.<04e0>I thought myself to be someone with no passion in<03e0>life except for the battlefield, but it seems there was<03e0>something<07f0>rather, someone else important to me.<04e0>I still don't even know where to begin my search,<03e0>but I'm sure these memories will come with time.<04e0>So, Rush, I would like to travel with you for a little<03e0>longer. I feel like my travels with you will help me<03e0>regain memories.
Hello, Rush.<03e0>I feel I'm on the verge of remembering a little more.
Good to see you, son.<03e0>I've just been here having a drink with an old friend.
Oho, our fearless leader.<03e0>Has something so dire come up that you need the<03e0>services of this old man?<04e0>When it comes to battle, the experiences of fighters<03e0>like me can be a good reference. Every so often young<03e0>warriors such as yourself come to me for advice.<04e0>But just now I was having a drink with a good friend.<04e0>He and I have been coming to this pub for a long,<03e0>long time. It's long been our spot to have a drink<03e0>after a battle. Next time, why don't you join us?<04e0>Ahh, but you're still young yet, aren't you. That<03e0>Marquis of Athlum would have my head for leading<03e0>you into temptation...ha ha ha.
My friend and I have been coming to this pub for<03e0>a long, long time. We relax here with a drink after<03e0>every battle.
You want to know about my friend?<03e0>Ahh... I suppose this starts what, thirty, forty<03e0>years back? We met on the battlefield.<04e0>We were both fresh recruits, shaking in our scales<03e0>to be in the middle of a real battle... We ended up<03e0>cheering each other on.<04e0>Ever since then, we were comrades in arms...<03e0>and rivals, at times.<04e0>But, you know, it's not like we're getting any younger.<03e0>Nowadays we spend a good deal more time meeting<03e0>in places like this than anything else...ha ha ha.
My friend is an old war buddy of mine. Nowadays<03e0>we spend a good deal more time meeting and drinking<03e0>here than anything else, though.
Heyyy, good timing!<03e0>I was just talking about you.<03e0>Zane, here<07f0>this's Rush!<04e0>Hm?<03e0>Where the devil'd he go? Can't believe he sneaked<03e0>off again...left me with the bill, to boot.<04e0>I swear Zane was right here a minute ago.<03e0>Rgh, he always does this...disappears right when<03e0>I need him. Like that time in Siebenbur...<04e0>Ahh, you know what, I think maybe I've had a li'l<03e0>too much to drink... *hic*
Can't believe Zane just up and disappeared like that...<03e0>Just like in Siebenbur, he just...<03e0>*hic*
What? That's...that's Zane's!<03e0>Ah. Ahh, you found it...<03e0>...<04e0>Three years ago...<03e0>There was a big operation to clean the beastmen<03e0>armies out of Siebenbur.<04e0>Zane was in charge of one of the main squads.<03e0>He knew the beast leader had to be taken down.<03e0>So he went after them...but didn't come back.<04e0>In the end, we beat back the beastmen. I didn't<03e0>hear about Zane until it was all over.<04e0>I couldn't believe it...I wouldn't believe Zane was<03e0>gone until I could see it with my own eyes.<04e0>I thought, if I came here, to the pub we always met<03e0>at, he'd eventually show up... I've been waiting ever<03e0>since.<04e0>I suppose I've been afraid to accept the truth...<04e0>But, seeing that ring, I can't run from reality any longer.<03e0>And...I think that finally, I'm alright with that.<04e0>It seems that even old as I am, I still need to work<03e0>on my discipline. ...Thank you, Rush.<04e0>Any time this old man can be of use, just say the<03e0>word. I'll help in any way I can.
Hello there, young one.<03e0>Any time this old man can be of use, just say the<03e0>word. I'll help in any way I can.
Welcome! Please make yourself at home.
If you touch my daughter you'll be joining<03e0>the Duchess's harem of eunuchs.<03e0>So make yourself comfortable!
Do you know Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis? Rumor has it<03e0>that his wife has run away from him. In fact, the couple<03e0>is infamous for not getting along, so no one is surprised...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
What in the world is the baron doing? The most<03e0>important thing a man can do is take care of<03e0>the home! Darling daughter, you agree, right?
Er, of course!
I don't want to believe it, but the rumor is that there's<03e0>a woman plotting to assassinate Duke Qubine...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Assassination... What a dangerous world this has<03e0>become! Beloved daughter, I think I'll have to<03e0>make your curfew earlier...
I...I see...
Apparently the desert princess has been sneaking out<03e0>of the castle to meet her lover.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Ohh, I completely sympathize with her mother.<03e0>Every parent wants to keep their daughter near.<03e0>Beloved daughter, you'd better stay at home for a while!
I...I see...
The desert princess has eloped!
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Whaaat!? That girl's poor parents! I hope they find<03e0>that beast of a man and hang him for the crime of<03e0>stealing a young girl's innocence!
Daddy, calm down!
Relations between Balterossa and Royotia have really<03e0>gone downhill. Families of soldiers are getting worried<03e0>since the armies are being mobilized...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Ugh, this is all due to that lecherous fiend who stole<03e0>away the princess. What an impressive list of crimes...<03e0>Beloved daughter, I'm sure you agree.
Er, of course!
So there's supposed to be something the Imperator<03e0>sealed out in the great swamp, but now the seal is<03e0>broken. Maybe it's the entrance to another world...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Once one enters another world, most likely they can't<03e0>return. Alright, beloved daughter, don't go to the swamp<03e0>until I say so!
O-okay...
Apparently one of the Forest Maidens bound to<03e0>a knight of the Order of Melphina can sense<03e0>what he's sensing.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Knights sworn to protect maidens... Perhaps I should<03e0>find my beloved daughter a knight as well... No<07f0>this<03e0>is my duty. Daddy will protect you with his life!
Er, thank you.
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina<03e0>are mobilizing... Seems something's happened to<03e0>the Last Leaf in Crookfen.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, seems the swamp has become more and more<03e0>dangerous. I can't have you going near it... Beloved<03e0>daughter, you mustn't leave the town for a while.
A-alright...
It's almost time for Kosmosfest, but apparently<03e0>the Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to Nagapur yet.<03e0>Maybe she got mixed up in something...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Kosmosfest... Beloved daughter, if you are very good,<03e0>then Daddy will take you to see it!
Yay...
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started<03e0>the Kosmosfest alright, but then it was interrupted<03e0>by monsters.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Whaaat!? Monsters at the festival!? No, no, this won't<03e0>do. Too dangerous! Sorry, beloved daughter, but<03e0>Daddy can't put you in that sort of danger.
O-oh...
An old-fashioned lady is looking to hire bodyguards,<03e0>I hear. She's supposed to be hanging out at the pub<03e0>near the canal.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Old-fashioned, hm? Beloved daughter, that is exactly<03e0>the sort of look you should cultivate! Yes, become<03e0>old-fashioned for Daddy, alright?
A-alright...
Do you like antiques?<03e0>Apparently a lot of the treasures of the Old Kingdoms<03e0>are turning up on the black market.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, the black market... My beloved daughter doesn't<03e0>need to be thinking about things like that! Alright,<03e0>forget what you just said, alright, dear?
O-okay...
There's a man looking for three very important stones<03e0>in the desert. Apparently they're very historically<03e0>significant.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
There are many secrets hidden within the desert<03e0>wastes. Beloved daughter, study up on the rich history<03e0>just outside your door!
O-okay...
A man interested in ancient magick is looking for<03e0>people to help out with research. Seems he's on<03e0>the verge of unlocking some huge mysteries.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Magick and mysteries...<03e0>It is an intriguing offer<07f0>I would go and help<07f0>but<03e0>I cannot leave my daughter's side.
Apparently there's a scary monster that was sealed<03e0>by one of the God Emperors, but came back...<03e0>People say the whole world is in danger!
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, the world is in danger... Don't worry, dear.<03e0>Daddy will protect you, even if it costs him his life...
Daddy...
Some amnesiac is wandering around the cities in<03e0>the desert, looking for something that could regain<03e0>his memory.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
To lose all one's memories...how terrible. If my<03e0>beloved daughter were to completely forget me,<03e0>I don't know what I'd do...my life would be over!
Daddy, calm down!
Recently people have been seeing an infamous bandit<03e0>around Athlum. Apparently he's waiting around for<03e0>someone but no one's brave enough to ask who.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
A bandit...not only dangerous, but a man...<03e0>No, no, no, this won't do. I forbid you from even<03e0>getting near Athlum, alright, dear?
O-okay...
There's a goddess statue in the Robelia Ruins that's<03e0>supposed to let you meet anyone in the world.<03e0>Someone who lost his sister is looking for it...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
What an amazing statue!<03e0>Beloved daughter, promise me that if we are ever<03e0>separated you will use that statue to find me.
O-okay...
There's a murderer on the loose in the capital!
That's the latest news, Daddy.
A murderer<07f0>in the capital!? ...Where is this "capital"?<03e0>It...it couldn't be here, is it? That's it, I forbid you to<03e0>take even one step out of the house!
O-oh...
There's a really big yama who needs help searching<03e0>for things... But he's a little...touched, so people have<03e0>been trying to keep out of his way.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Lost items...a pity. But look, honey, if you ever lose<03e0>anything at all, you come tell me first, alright?<03e0>Daddy will find it for you, no matter what.
A-alright...
Some white qsiti's been looking for a magickal book.<03e0>People seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's<03e0>been able to place him.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Magickal tomes... I studied the intricacies of ancient<03e0>magicks when I was young. Beloved daughter, if you<03e0>have interest in the subject, then study it well!
A-alright...
A set of twins have turned up as mercenaries lately,<03e0>really capable ones. Apparently they're really pretty,<03e0>but maybe a little standoffish.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm... I don't want to seem sexist, but mercenaries are<03e0>always putting their life on the line... No, daughter,<03e0>I believe I must forbid you from becoming one!
O-okay...
A man in the Great Sand Sea's been looking for<03e0>challengers for some sort of game. But apparently<03e0>he only wants really special people to play.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Some "game" with some man!? No, oh no.<03e0>That's it, daughter, I forbid you from going to the desert.<03e0>Don't even get close!
A-alright...
Some elderly warrior's been crossing the Great<03e0>Sand Sea, looking for a special sword.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
An elderly man searching for a sword...<03e0>It must hold incredible significance to him.<03e0>You understand, my daughter?
Y-yes...
The guards of Ghor have all sworn to follow their ruler<03e0>for as long as they live.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Mmm... With a guard that dedicated, the ruler must<03e0>certainly be great. Beloved daughter, you may go to<03e0>that town any time.
Y-yay...
There's not a family in the world as dedicated as<03e0>the Honeywells. If you've got them at your back,<03e0>you can do anything.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
The matriarch of the Honeywells is indeed a formidable<03e0>woman. But being a warrior is too dangerous for<03e0>my daughter! I forbid you from becoming one!
A-alright...
Apparently Athlum's General Torgal is supposed to<03e0>have some things in his past that're coming back<03e0>to haunt him, centered in Royotia...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Something from the general's past...hrm.<03e0>Beloved daughter, I forbid you from getting close to<03e0>men with troubled pasts, alright?
O-okay...
The legendary fighting tourney is about to start.<03e0>Anyone with fighting spirit is invited to participate.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Legendary it may be, it's still dangerous. I forbid you<03e0>from watching such violence! ...You weren't thinking<03e0>of participating, were you!?
N-no...
Apparently there's some mystic academy that's been<03e0>training skilled magi for years.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Ohh, how nostalgic! The academy is my alma mater,<03e0>you know. It would be a fine school for you as well,<03e0>beloved daughter.
O-okay...
Athlum's been going through some tough times, and<03e0>people are worried about the new matriarch of<03e0>the Honeywell clan because she's so young.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
It must be tough... To lose her mother, then take up<03e0>a sword all alone... Beloved daughter, when I die, I forbid<03e0>you from becoming a swordswoman!
O-okay...
Recently there's been gossip about Athlum's Marquis's<03e0>love interests...or lack thereof.<03e0>He's never been connected with anybody.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, and he is that age... Alright, beloved daughter,<03e0>I forbid you from going to Athlum for a while!
O-okay...
The old head of the Academy's been seen in pubs<03e0>across the continent lately. I guess anyone would<03e0>want to drown their sorrows after what happened.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
The Academy's former director? Is that a man or<03e0>a woman? If it's a man, I know one pub he won't be<03e0>going to!
O-okay...
Dr. Sykes has been seen going in and out of Athlum<03e0>Castle often lately. Maybe they've made some sort<03e0>of discovery?
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Oh, a new discovery from the famed scientists...<03e0>intriguing. Beloved daughter, shall we take a trip to<03e0>Athlum to see what the fuss is about?
A-alright...
Some unidentified flying object's been spotted<03e0>swooping around Wyrmskeep. Apparently people<03e0>are really frightened.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Unidentified flying object!? No, no, far too dangerous!<03e0>I forbid you from even going close to Nagapur!
O-okay...
Some hot-blooded female warrior is trying to hunt down<03e0>that group causing trouble in Crookfen. But it's against<03e0>her boss's wishes...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
There is nothing wrong with a bit of a tomboy, but if<03e0>she's too hot-blooded, it just leads to trouble...<03e0>Promise me, daughter, that you will never act so rashly!
A-alright...
A monster army has appeared in the Great Sand Sea<03e0>and is threatening Balterossa. They're so powerful...it<03e0>seems like we're in trouble.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Mmm, there is no reason to go to the Great Sand Sea...<03e0>I will make certain I don't have any errands that would<03e0>send you there, beloved daughter.
According to ancient historians, there's something<03e0>dangerous enough to destroy entire cities sealed<03e0>within the volcano...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Inside the volcano... If it were to cause an eruption,<03e0>there would be nowhere to run. Alright, daughter,<03e0>I forbid you from getting close to the volcano!
O-okay...
No one knows anything about what's going on inside<03e0>the volcano... But, the Marquis of Royotia might have<03e0>some ideas.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
It seems the volcano has not ceased being dangerous.<03e0>I know you don't have a reason to go there, but you are<03e0>still forbidden to go to the volcano!
O-okay...
You know there's a town without anyone running it?<03e0>The old ruler's sons are fighting over the seat of power.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, sounds like a very dangerous place to me.<03e0>Beloved daughter, I forbid you from going to any town<03e0>without a ruler!
O-okay...
When you're out in the desert, you can hear this sad,<03e0>lonely voice crying from beneath the Great Sand Sea.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Cries from the desert floor... That sounds suspicious no<03e0>matter how you slice it! Daughter, even if you go to<03e0>the Great Sand Sea, I forbid you from going beneath it!
O-okay...
A long time ago, there used to be a famed hero that<03e0>lived in the Great Sand Sea.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
