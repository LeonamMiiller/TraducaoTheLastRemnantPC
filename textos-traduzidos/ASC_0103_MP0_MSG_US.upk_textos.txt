Oho, you've made it this far into town?<03e0>Welcome to <1be0ffbe34ff>Virtus Parish<1ce0>, lad.<04e0>If there's anything<07f0>or anyone<07f0>you're looking for, head<03e0>over there to the <1be0ffbe34ff>pub<1ce0>. You're sure to find someone there<03e0>who can help you out.

To think that one man could throw all of Athlum into<03e0>such chaos... Yet that's just what that Conqueror<03e0>person's done.<04e0>The toughs who usually lurk in the back alleys saw him<03e0>and ran off crying!<04e0>...I suppose I did the same thing.
Walking the streets here, all you hear are voices of<03e0>unease. And people say it's because the Valeria Heart<03e0>is gone... What's that all about!?<04e0>Are we supposed to be such superstitious old biddies<03e0>that we can't have any confidence of our own?<04e0>Our strength doesn't come from any Remnant<07f0>it<03e0>comes from ourselves!<04e0>...Well, that's what the bartender was going on about<03e0>earlier, anyhow.
Athlum's independent... I don't see how that's<03e0>supposed to change anything for me, but if everybody<03e0>else is celebrating, I might as well join in, right?
Lord David's gonna challenge the Conqueror!?<04e0>Well...I guess a jerk like that can't be left to do whatever<03e0>he pleases, he's gotta be smacked down and put away<03e0>for good! I'll be rooting for our boys!
Historically, there's been a lot of tectonic activity<03e0>around here. That's why there're so many caves in the<03e0>area.<04e0>It's only thanks to the Valeria Heart that the ground<03e0>beneath Athlum is stable.

It's said the Conqueror's army comes from far to the<03e0>east, a land called Veyriel.<04e0>It's a place so remote, they don't even have cities<07f003e0>just scattered collections of shacks.<04e0>For someone from a place like that to be able to<03e0>overwhelm Athlum so easily...<04e0>What sort of person is that Conqueror anyhow?
Now that Duke Ghor has become chairman of the<03e0>Congress, the search for new Remnants has been going<03e0>with full force.<04e0>Along the way, people have found all sorts of previously<03e0>undiscovered areas.
Now it goes to the northern shore!<03e0>I knew everything was connected somehow...<04e0>What am I talking about? Siebenbur, what else?<03e0>They've found another entrance at the northern<03e0>shore.
It seems that Duke Qubine has recognized Athlum's<03e0>independence. I wonder what machinations went on<03e0>behind the scenes to make him agree?
Hmm... It's true that if the Conqueror is left to his own<03e0>devices, he'll certainly cause trouble, or possibly do<03e0>something else terrible...<04e0>But he has the God Emperor's backing. I certainly hope<03e0>this doesn't come back to haunt us...
Lord David's Remnant, the Gae Bolg, is incredibly<03e0>powerful...but using it comes at the cost of the life of<03e0>the person it's bound to.<04e0>We probably haven't noticed it thus far, but perhaps the<03e0>use of all Remnants comes at a certain price...

Everyone in this city has experienced suffering at one<03e0>point or another, but now, without the Valeria Heart, it all<03e0>seems so much worse.<04e0>Maybe...maybe we're being tested<07f0>to see if we can live<03e0>without Remnants.<04e0>I don't know what the future holds, but we've got to at<03e0>least give it a try, don't you think?
So, it seems the Congress has delegated people to find<03e0>new Remnants to replace those stolen by the Conqueror.<04e0>And now that everyone knows what the Gwayn did to<03e0>Nagapur...<04e0>Fools! Are they looking for a repeat of that performance<03e0>across the continent?
An independent Athlum... I still can't believe it.<04e0>However, the tough part is yet to come... For better or<03e0>for worse, we'll all have to gird ourselves and work<03e0>together.
Why is it that the only thing people can ever decide<03e0>on is war?<04e0>I want to believe in Lord David, I really do, but I can't<03e0>help but think he's making a foolish decision...
Oy. Ya better watch yer step around this part o' town...<03e0>Ya might find people ain't so nice ta kids what look like<03e0>they got a bit o' coin.<04e0>'Course, Lord David's cleaned most o' the real bad<03e0>trash out of town. But ya still can't be too careful.
Word on the street is that people're hosin' themselves<03e0>over some Conqueror guy what's been terrorizin' cities<03e0>like it's going out of style.<04e0>What spineless nose-pickers! If that big blond douche<03e0>tries coming to Athlum, I'll kick his ass so hard he'll<03e0>feel it from the front!
*sob* ... *sniffle*<03e0>Lady Emma...<03e0>S-she covered us so we could get away...<04e0>An'-an' then, the Valeria Heart came whipping down from<03e0>the sky... I-I think I had an accident...
Shit, just 'cuz the Valeria Heart's gone don't mean the<03e0>town's got to be all doom and gloom and destruction or<03e0>whatever.<04e0>Lord David's already findin' us a new symbol, right?<04e0>So, I was thinking I should help out, an' go find one too.<04e0>Then won't nobody have a thing to worry about.<03e0>I could find us a new Remnant in a hot minute!
Independence? Meanin'...<04e0>...Ohh...meanin' those turdholes in Celapaleis won't be<03e0>able to get away with lookin' down their noses at us<03e0>anymore! Yeahhh, eat it, bitches!
The Conqueror, eh? Kick that old bitch's can until<03e0>he cries!
The soldiers who went to the Robelia Ruins still<03e0>haven't returned... If only Lady Emma could investigate...
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...<04e0>You there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah...why?<09e008e0010000000000>You're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
*snort* Playing dumb won't get you anywhere<07f0>if you're<03e0>playing at all.<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...<04e0>You're Rush Sykes, right?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup, I'm Rush!<09e008e0010000000000>Nope, I'm, uh, someone else.
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.<04e0>He says he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>information-gathering, and that you should come to<03e0>the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> for details.<04e0>Got it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,<03e0>though<07f0>you're not in trouble...not with us at least.<03e0>Lord David's put out a summons for you.<04e0>Apparently he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>your information-gathering, so he'd like you to come<03e0>to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> so he can share it with you.<04e0>Don't make him wait too long, okay, kid? Or else you<03e0>might end up in trouble with us after all... Just joking!
Ohh! That valiant form...<04e0>You must be Rush Sykes, are you not?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The one and only!<09e008e0010000000000>Depends on who's asking.
Well met!<03e0>David, Marquis of Athlum requests that you come<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Athlum Castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!<03e0>I bring a message from Lord David. He requests that<03e0>you come to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Sorry, hon, we're still getting ready. I really wanted to<03e0>have something for our troops to use before they march...<04e0>*sigh* The best-laid plans, you know?
The hell do you want?<04e0>Don't you know who I am? If we don't got business<03e0>then you'd better leave me the hell alone.
You ever heard of the savage mountain bandit<03e0>Loki? The one yer ma talked about along with<03e0>the boogeyman? That's me.<04e0>I'm trash, alright? A bad guy. Get seen talking to<03e0>me and your precious reputation'll be ruined.<04e0>Get it? Stay the hell away from me.
I'm the mountain bandit Loki, get it? A bad guy.<03e0>If you value what's dear to ya, you'll stay the hell<03e0>away.
When I was born, a huge disaster hit my<03e0>village. The whole place was almost destroyed.<04e0>Everyone in town said I was cursed...said all I<03e0>could do was bring bad luck. Only a baby and<03e0>they completely loathed me.<04e0>So I grew up, and I hated them right back,<03e0>every last damned person in that village.<04e0>I beat 'em up, cursed 'em out... By the end,<03e0>even my own ma couldn't stand me...
From the day I was born, the people in my village said<03e0>I was cursed. Every damned person in that town<03e0>hated my guts. Even my own ma...
So I left the village, and started making a name for<03e0>myself as the fierce bandit Loki.<04e0>Killing people, hunting 'em down, hating them...<03e0>Every day, that's all I did. And that was all I wanted<03e0>to do.<04e0>But one day I met this kid...<03e0>Frackin' changed everything.<04e0>I'm finishing up a job<07f0>casing this house<07f0>when<03e0>I realize there's a little girl there. I don't screw<03e0>around, I go on and pull my knife.<04e0>But right at the part where they usually start<03e0>screaming and wailing, she pops out and says hi,<03e0>all cheery-like.<04e0>Says she just wants to talk...says she wants to be<03e0>friends. Turns out the girl's blind.<04e0>'Course, I didn't believe it at first. I figured she was<03e0>like the rest, tryin' to pull one over on me. But turned<03e0>out she just wanted a friend.<04e0>It was the first time that'd ever happened...the<03e0>first time I'd come across someone who was<03e0>actually happy I was there. The first and only...<04e0>I mean, hell, my own parents don't want shit to do<03e0>with me, and this random little girl<07f0>Reya's her<03e0>name<07f0>wants to be pals. Ain't that a trip...<04e0>...Seriously, she saved me.<03e0>Who knows what I woulda become...<04e0>That's why I been searching for something to fix her<03e0>eyesight all this time. She's done so much for me...<03e0>I wanna at least try to pay her back.
There ain't a single person in the world who's wanted<03e0>anything to do with me but Reya. That's why I been<03e0>looking for something to fix her eyesight...I owe her.
Guess I owe ya one, Rush.<04e0>My eyes work fine, but my heart wasn't letting 'em see<03e0>worth a damn. All I'd ever see was darkness and pain.<04e0>It's only thanks to Reya that I been able to clear some<03e0>o' that darkness away...her an'...<04e0>Huh. It's funny how easy it is to find friends.<03e0>You just gotta open up a little.
You again. 'Sup.
