Sir Rush! I was able to meet Paris!<03e0>He is willing to help me stop this war...
Charlotte, we haven't much time.<03e0>We must bring Rush up to speed...
Oh, yes!
After our incident with the seer, I returned<03e0>to investigate his home. There I found some<03e0>letters outlining a plot...<04e0>It was to induce Royotia and Balterossa to<03e0>deploy their armies, and then use a legion of<03e0>monsters to completely destroy both forces.<04e0>The letters were coded, their true content hidden<03e0>in innocuous-looking phrases, so it took some<03e0>time to decrypt the message.
Someone was trying to manipulate our<03e0>countries into war. Mother and Paris's father<03e0>both fell for their tricks...
They took advantage of both our relationship,<03e0>and Father and the Duchess's distrust of each<03e0>other. To think we were all played so easily...
Paris...
Both Royotia and Balterossa are in great danger.<03e0>However, we cannot approach both at once. Where<03e0>should we stop them from?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Off to Balterossa!<09e008e0010000000000>Off to Royotia!
We should start in Balterossa, then. They are fighting at<03e0>a battleground known as the <1be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Tongue<1ce0>.<04e0>Of course, afterwards we should save the Royotians as<03e0>well. Either way, time is of the essence.
We should head to Royotia first, yes? The troops are<03e0>making their stand at the <1be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Belly<1ce0>.<04e0>Let us hurry, so that we may save the Balterossans as<03e0>well!
Paris, is that truly alright? The Royotian Guard is also<03e0>under attack by monsters!
I know. Let's hurry to save them!<04e0>To the <1be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Belly<1ce0>!
Then it's off to help the Balterossan army.<03e0>There's no time to lose!
Please, Paris, Sir Rush, save the Balterossans!<04e0>They are at a place called the <1be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Tongue<1ce0>!
The beasts have fled.<03e0>And both forces have withdrawn.<04e0>There were casualties, but thankfully,<03e0>major losses were avoided.
The world is so agitated that it even doubts<03e0>the power of Remnants... Why must something<03e0>like this bring us to war?
Charlotte...all hope is not lost.<03e0>There is still something we can do...<03e0>Something only we can do.<04e0>Together, we can bring many people happiness.
Paris...<04e0>But... All I've done is hurt you.<03e0>After that, how could you still want me?
Oh Charlotte...<03e0>The pain you caused me was like someone taking a<03e0>fiery dagger to my heart.<04e0>Yet through that searing pain, I felt a sweet melancholy,<03e0>as if the instrument of torture branding my heart was<03e0>soaked with tears...<04e0>Tears you yourself had shed from the brutal memories<03e0>of causing such anguish to your one true love.<04e0>I loved you enough to let you go... Such emotion is<03e0>not easily forgotten. I only dream that a fraction of<03e0>this love is returned.
Paris...<03e0>Yes. Always.
Then... I must win over my pig-headed father!
Yes, and I will tell Mother...<03e0>Somehow, I'll make her understand!
Sir Rush, come to the tavern later, alright?<03e0>I'll have something for you!
