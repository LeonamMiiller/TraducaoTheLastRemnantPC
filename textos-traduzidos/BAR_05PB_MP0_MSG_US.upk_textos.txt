Well, well! It's been a spell since we've had a new face.<03e0>Welcome to the Rift!
All the mess that guy talks, and when it's actually<03e0>dangerous, that's when he actually follows through?<03e0>Foolish old man...<04e0>And what's up with leaving that ridiculous letter?<04e0>"Not trying to cause trouble"<07f0>more like "there's<03e0>nothing you can do to stop me"!
I saw you and Wyngale fight that giant monster.<04e0>Thanks.
I saw you and Wyngale fight that giant monster.<04e0>Thanks. I'm sure the old man's laughing his head off<03e0>up past the pearly gates.
Hey! Howdy, traveler! Don't see many like you<03e0>'round these parts. Sit and drink a spell!
Well I'll be! It's been a spell since I've had a<03e0>customer. What can I do you for, sir?
What's this? You, you are an unfamiliar face.<03e0>Doing a bit of traveling, sport?<04e0>Take a seat, have some tea. At least it doesn't have<03e0>any problems with it... I'm the owner here, and you<03e0>wouldn't believe the troubles I've had.<04e0>I actually started out in Balterossa. Never have to<03e0>worry about having too few customers there, eh?<03e0>It's pricey though. I couldn't turn a profit.<04e0>So...that's how I ended up out here on<03e0>the edge of the world.
Sad thing is<07f0>and this is where it really adds insult to<03e0>injury<07f0>even this tiny pub out in the boonies couldn't<03e0>be run all alone.<04e0>So...I was desperate. I went to town, found two guys<03e0>who looked like they didn't have anything else to do,<03e0>and hired 'em. Talk about an epic failure!<04e0>Where do I start? The younger guy's a lazy dog. I've<03e0>seen corpses that're more productive, ugh. But you<03e0>know how mitra can be...no offense.<04e0>Then the old guy, bless him, he's enthusiastic enough,<03e0>but completely incompetent. Can't remember customer<03e0>orders for the life of him.<04e0>The customers themselves are mostly down-and-out<03e0>mercenaries, so not really the type you wanna get too<03e0>friendly with, you know?<04e0>*sigh*<04e0>I always dreamed of having a bustling pub full of<03e0>attractive patrons having stimulating conversations<03e0>about adventure and intrigue...
Ach, sorry, sorry. You come in here for a drink and<03e0>then I end up talking your ear off.<04e0>Anyway, next time you come out here, come back and<03e0>visit, alright? There'll be a hot pot of tea waiting for<03e0>you, my treat.
In addition to an impressive selection of wines and<03e0>spirits, here at The Rift we offer tea with every order.<04e0>The tea leaves are imported from Melphina<07f0>and<03e0>don't think it doesn't cost a fortune.<04e0>Still, thanks to that, we keep a steady stream of<03e0>customers all day long. ...Er, until recently, anyhow.
Hey, sport! How's it going? You would not believe what's<03e0>been going on with me lately, it's just terrible, terrible.<03e0>See<07f004e0>...You don't wanna listen? You have to go?<04e0>Oh. I...I see.
Ohh! Heya, sport!<04e0>Yanno, when I heard some legendary monster'd been<03e0>reborn or whatever, I was all ready to close up shop.<03e0>Damn shame too, after coming all this way and all...<04e0>So you can imagine my relief to find that you guys<03e0>took care of all the trouble! Talk about good news!<03e0>I guess I like this town more than I thought.
Hey, someone else from the "outside." I'm not from<03e0>here either... Last year I was hired to escort a guy out<03e0>here.<04e0>Thing is, once we made it to town, the guy disappeared<03e0>without paying me!<04e0>I've been trapped here since then... I'm just working<03e0>to make enough cash to get out of this hole.<04e0>Nothing happens here at all...this place is like a complete<03e0>waste of space. I can't wait to get the hell out!
Oh, hey, outsider.<03e0>Don't worry about the dishes, alright?<04e0>I finally saved up enough to leave Grentze, but I think<03e0>I'm gonna hang around a little bit longer.<04e0>I mean, look at these people. Leaving them alone is like<03e0>sending a bunch of toddlers to face the Ghor army.<03e0>I'm not that cruel!
Oh man... So apparently, this legendary god-demon<03e0>thing<07f0>no one here can decide which<07f0>has been<03e0>awakened. People are going bananas.<04e0>Geez, I guess it's up to me to take care of everyone...<03e0>I mean, I am a mercenary, after all. Fighting's what I do.<04e0>And I'll fight to protect this town!
Wyngale stole my gig!<03e0>Didn't I say I was gonna be protecting Grentze?<04e0>...Heh, psych. I tried heading over there and my knees<03e0>started shaking like they were gonna give out...<03e0>Thought I was gonna die just looking at the thing.<04e0>Seriously, Wyngale is this town's hero.
You again?<04e0>I'm on break, alright? Leave me alone.
You again.<04e0>Look. I can understand why you'd want to talk to<03e0>me<07f0>I know how impressionable young boys are,<03e0>but break time is me-time, alright?<04e0>...<04e0>...The hell is that stupid expression for?<03e0>Oh, don't tell me...<03e0>You don't have the slightest idea who I am, do you?<04e0>Well, damn.<03e0>I didn't know people like you even existed.
You have no idea who I am, do you?<03e0>I didn't know they made kids like you anymore.
Hey.<03e0>Seriously, you've never heard of me?<04e0>Not to toot my own horn, but in the world of mercenaries,<03e0>I'm known as the King.<04e0>Sure, I figured downgrading from war contracts to little<03e0>jobs like this might get me ragged on or something,<03e0>but an employer who doesn't know me from Adam?<04e0>...Whatever. Just looking at you I can tell you're just a<03e0>little puppy, still suckling at his mama's teat, eh?<03e0>How 'bout it then, why don't you test your hand?<04e0>Gotta warn you, though<07f0>just a bout or two of<03e0>sparring ain't gonna bless you with my luck in battle.<03e0>Hahahahaha!<04e0>...<04e0>...You could at least pretend to look interested.
Not to toot my own horn, but when it comes to<03e0>mercenaries, I'm known as the King.<03e0>C'mon, how 'bout you show me your moves?
Pup, you're back!<03e0>You ready to show me what you've got?<04e0>...What, now you look like someone stole your last<03e0>bone. Don't like being called a little puppy, do you?<04e0>Don't get me wrong, kid, I'm not trying to put you<03e0>down to look big or anything.<04e0>In fact, you got a good look in your eye... I can tell<03e0>you're a fighter. Let's focus that...make you<03e0>actually worth something.<04e0>Whaddaya think of that, me as your teacher?<03e0>If you ask me, I think you should feel honored.<04e0>What, you doubt my skill? You think I'm full of it?<03e0>Feh. Think what you want. So what're you gonna<03e0>do about it?<04e0>If you know someone who thinks they could beat me,<03e0>bring 'em on. I'll show 'em how strong<07f0>or weak<07f0>they<03e0>really are. Hahahahaha!
Heya, pup!<03e0>You know someone who thinks they can beat me?<03e0>Bring 'em on! I'll show them the error of their ways.
You again? You seriously don't understand the point<03e0>of time off, do you? Just let me rest, ugh. I feel like<03e0>the Sacred Lands fell on me.<04e0>This's all your doing, isn't it? Some yama in a mask<03e0>comes up to challenge me to a fight<07f0>come on, like<03e0>I wouldn't know it's Duke Ghor.<04e0>He was carrying the Bilqis, for crying out loud. What<03e0>the hell kind of idiots is he used to dealing with?<04e0>Damn... Thanks to that, I can't feel my face...<04e0>Sorry, Rush. I took a little bruise to my pride and let<03e0>it blow up into all this mess.<04e0>Guess I shouldn't slack on my training either. Whaddya<03e0>think, Rush, you up for some lessons? I wasn't lying<03e0>when I said I saw a lot of potential in you.<04e0>Of course, the number one thing a mercenary needs<03e0>is strength! So the first thing we gotta do is eat!<03e0>Hahahahahahaha!!!
Rush. We got some time off, eh? You up for some<03e0>training? Or maybe we can grab a bite to eat.
Words are written on a stained, yellowed paper.<03e0>It seems to be a letter.<04e0>"Grentze is in danger, and it's up to me to defend it.<03e0>  So I'm off to defeat the Fallen (somehow)!<04e0>  I'm not trying to cause trouble for the bartender or<03e0>  nothing, but I can't sit idly by while the world<03e0>  is in trouble.<04e0>  But don't worry! I called my twin brother from<03e0>  Balterossa to take care of things. You won't even<03e0>  know I'm gone! Except for this letter, I guess.<04e0>  All righty, so here I go! Even if I can't give that thing<03e0>  more than a paper cut, I'll make sure it's one that<03e0>  stings! Gahahaha!"
I'm the cutesy-wutsey girl what attracts boys like you to<03e0>our shop!<04e0>But don't get fresh<07f0>I'm not really a girl!<04e0>Gahahahaha!
...
Apparently, Sir Nielsen of Celapaleis's wife's<03e0>run off. ...'Course, those two are famous for<03e0>not getting along, so it's no big deal.
...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
And she's gonna marry me instead!<03e0>Woo, will Granny be jealous!<03e0>Gahahahaha!
Seems there's some crazy woman plotting to<03e0>assassinate Duke Qubine...

And so you should keep yer eyes on me!<03e0>I'll go save that li'l kid before you can say boo!<03e0>Gahahahaha!
So, apparently the desert princess has been sneaking<03e0>out of the castle pretty regularly to meet some guy<03e0>she's been mooning over.

Izzat so. And?
And so, it's time for me to transform into a prince!<03e0>Surprised ya, huh?<03e0>Gahahahaha!

Izzat so. And?
And it wasn't me...<03e0>Surprised ya, huh?<03e0>Gahahahaha!

And so I've a mind to get my sword and go over an'<03e0>maintain the peace! Now, don't try to stop me<07f003e0>I'm unstoppable! Gahahahaha!
So there's supposed to be something the Imperator<03e0>sealed out in the great swamp... Problem is, the seal's<03e0>broken. Could be the entrance to some other world...

Izzat so. And?
And so I've a mind to go seal it myself!<03e0>Now, don't try to stop me or anything!<03e0>Gahahahaha!
Apparently one of the Forest Maidens bound to<03e0>a knight of the Order of Melphina can sense<03e0>what he's sensing.

I can feel there's gonna be a disaster...<03e0>Gahahahaha!
It's almost time for Kosmosfest, huh.<03e0>But apparently the Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to<03e0>Nagapur yet. Maybe she got mixed up in something...
...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
So I'm thinking I should go save her! I can't let<03e0>a sweet little thing like that be all by her lonesome.<03e0>I'd be her knight in shining armor! Gahahaha!
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started<03e0>the Kosmosfest alright. Usually the ceremony's a bunch<03e0>of hooey, but this time it was interrupted by monsters.
...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?

...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
And so I've a mind to go save those treasures myself!<03e0>Then I'd be known as the famous protector of<03e0>ancient treasures! Gahahahaha!
Some guy is looking for these three stones that're<03e0>really important to the desert. Historically significant,<03e0>or something.

There's a goddess statue in the Robelia Ruins that's<03e0>supposed to let you meet anyone in the world, no<03e0>matter how far. Some kid is looking for it.

The guards of Ghor have all sworn to follow<03e0>their ruler for as long as they live.
...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
And so it's obvious these kiddies have never<03e0>met me! I'd show 'em a real man to follow!<03e0>Gahahahaha!

...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?

Izzat so. And?
I can't believe they didn't send me a personal<03e0>invitation! You'd think I'd be in high demand, eh?<03e0>Gahahahaha!

...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!

Izzat so. And?
Yanno, Baaluk's been around ever since I was born!<03e0>So, what's my ancient history, eh?<03e0>Gahahahaha!

Izzat so. And?

...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
OooOOOooo, scary, innit?<03e0>Gahahahaha!

Izzat so. And?
...For some reason, I feel like I'd get on pretty well<03e0>with this feller. Strange, innit?<03e0>Gahahahaha!

I'll take care of this!<03e0>...Right after finishing the dishes, that is.<03e0>Gahahahaha!
Young adventurers have gotten into trading the<03e0>different loot they find on their trips these days.<03e0>Seems Royotia's the main hub for the fad.

Izzat so. And?
Maybe I should join in, eh?<03e0>Gahahahaha!
Royotian merchants are getting frustrated with<03e0>Balterossa...they control all of their trade routes.

Some yamaan mercenary's out looking for a partner.<03e0>Could be a good way to make a few G.

So, apparently there's a mysterious woman<03e0>about...the type that's real hard to get with.<03e0>Seems she's got the whole world on her shoulders...
...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
A looker like me shouldn't have any trouble giving<03e0>her what she's looking for, eh? Gahahahaha!
You've probably seen them if you've been hanging<03e0>around Crookfen, but Bloody Alice has been<03e0>gathering. Looks like something big's going on...
...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
And so of course they're meeting up since they're<03e0>all fans of me! Gahahahaha!
Seems the Jhana have been popping up in the Great<03e0>Sand Sea. You wouldn't think they'd have forgotten<03e0>being blasted by the Gae Bolg already...
...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
Yanno, once I fought some Jhana in a fierce<03e0>duel to the death! ...Except, not so much.<03e0>Gahahahaha!
Recently the Silver Falcons took out a pack<03e0>of Jhana.
...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
When you think "Silver Falcon" you think of me,<03e0>right? I mean, look at this head of hair!<03e0>Gahahahaha!
The Silver Falcons have been going after<03e0>the remnants of the Conqueror's army.<03e0>Who knows what those guys could be up to...
...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
I'll help out on this one too! Somebody's gotta be<03e0>the one to run around like a chicken with its head<03e0>cut off, right? Gahahahaha!
Some gloomy-looking guy's been hanging around the pub<03e0>in Elysion recently...bumming everyone out.
...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
Elysion...that's a pretty darned legendary city!<03e0>That's where I proposed to Granny, of course!<03e0>Gahahahaha!
