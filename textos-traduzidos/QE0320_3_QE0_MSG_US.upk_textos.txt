Darned tooting we will!<03e0>Like we could just leave Pagus alone in a<03e0>dangerous place like this!
...'Sides, we can't let Pagus and the kid walk<03e0>off with all the glory, eh?
Yoo-hoo, Pagus, you here?<04e0>Don't tell me he's already taken out the<03e0>monster!
Lavafender's blustering hells...!<04e0>I heard the monster was supposed to be big,<03e0>but this is just ridiculous!
Pagus!
Darned tooting we did!<04e0>We're talking about the Arco Iris here...<03e0>If all three of us can't see it together,<03e0>what's the point?
But, seems like Maddox was right about it after<03e0>all... I guess I just imagined seeing it.
I was so certain I saw the Arco Iris...<04e0>Ha, but there's nothing here now, huh...
Geh! Pagus, you keep going around saying stuff<03e0>like that, I'll get all misty-eyed... *sniff*
Welp, at the very least we took out that<03e0>massive monster, eh? C'mon, let's get back to<03e0>Royotia.
You too, kiddo!<03e0>I'll treat you to dinner or something!
Hum...<03e0>So, we're to sneak into the cave as well?
Hahaha, I agree with you there!<03e0>This reminds me of our<03e0>adventures back then...<04e0>...Alright. Into the breach! To the Arco Iris.
Mmm, that would be an astonishing feat indeed!
Of course, as the former general of Celapaleis's<03e0>Third Division, defeating monsters like this would<03e0>be as easy as taking candy from a baby...
Erm. Perhaps "baby" isn't quite the<03e0>correct term...
Pagus!
Sibal...
...That is the miracle given us by the Arco Iris?
Maddox! Sibal! Fear not, I'm here to save you!
Are you two alright!?<03e0>Goodness me, I didn't think you'd follow us...
No... Certainly, you met the Remnant of<03e0>Miracles, Sibal.
Maddox...Sibal... The time we three were<03e0>engrossed in the mystery of the Arco Iris is<03e0>many years past.
As time passed, we went our separate ways, doing<03e0>different things and living different lives, perhaps<03e0>never to meet again...<04e0>And yet here we are, on an adventure, at that!<03e0>It really brings back memories, doesn't it?
Ahem. My point here is, just the fact that we're<03e0>all here together again...
