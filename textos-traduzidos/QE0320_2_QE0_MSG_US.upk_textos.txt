Eh? Those crow's-feet and that giant yap...<04e0>Damnation, if it isn't Pagus!<03e0>Cripes, you're a sight for sore eyes!
Darned tooting I do!<03e0>And I've sure got reason for it, you know! I've<03e0>only made the biggest discovery of the century!<04e0>Pagus<07f0>you're gonna flip when you hear this,<03e0>but<07f001e00be00ae0>
Maddox! Gabbering God Emperors, you just took<03e0>ten years off my life!<04e0>But huh! I've got not only one of Athlum's Four<03e0>Generals come to see me, but an ex-general of<03e0>the Celapaleian Army! The star power!
The Arco Iris is a Remnant that takes the form<03e0>of a seven-colored light.<04e0>The old stories say that the guy what had it<03e0>was granted all kinds of miracles.<04e0>As for me... Well, I was digging in <1be0ffbe34ff>Siebenbur<1ce003e0>not long ago, when out of the blue, I'm hit by<03e0>this dazzling beam of light.<04e0>Thing is, I was deep underground, way past<03e0>any place the sun could hit, see?
It's just like all the history books said...<03e0>A rainbow of light shot straight over my head.<04e0>I...I can't even begin to describe how beautiful it was...<03e0>Something that stunning could only be the work of<03e0>the gods.
Whaaat? You calling me a liar!?
Reckon so. Just, you can't right now.<03e0>Some huge monster's taken the place as its lair.<03e004e0>Until somebody cleans the place out, you've got more<03e0>of a chance of seeing the inside of the monster's<03e0>belly than seeing the Arco Iris.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Then call me "the Cleaninator"!<09e008e0010000000300>(This sounds kinda scary...)
Right, kid<07f0>if somethin's in the way, mow<03e0>it down, eh?<04e0>But if you think you can underestimate this<03e0>bugger, you're in for a rude surprise, kiddo.
The miners of Royotia<07f0>no slouches in the<03e0>physical power department<07f0>have tangled with<03e0>the thing more than a couple times...<04e0>They haven't won once. Don't go off half-cocked,<03e0>alright, kid? You'll regret it.
(Meaning...)<03e006e0000008e0000000000000>Kill the monster, see the Remnant!<09e008e0010000000300>(I'll leave it to these guys.)
Enough theatrics, Sibal, I've already told him.
Come now, are you certain you didn't just<03e0>spend too much time underground and started<03e0>seeing things? Lack of oxygen, perhaps?
If we go there, we should be able to see the<03e0>Arco Iris as well, correct?
Sibal! It's been thirty years...far too long.<03e0>You look well<07f0>high-spirited as always!
Maddox, Sibal, please!<03e0>Let's try to act our age, shall we?
Still. To think that the Remnant of Miracles is real...<04e0>Sibal, you've been able to taste a part of a<03e0>legend over 640 years old. Dear me,<03e0>you've really done something incredible!
Gahahah! Send your kids out here anytime!<03e0>Throw 'em in the mines, I'll look after 'em for you!
Eheh, sorry about that...
Say, kid<07f0>ah, Rush. Sorry for the trouble<07f0>I've<03e0>put you through a lot, eh?
I know he's a meddlesome old coot, but take<03e0>good care of Pagus for me, would you?
Well! I certainly hadn't felt that sort of fear<03e0>or excitement in a long while.<04e0>Truly, I mustn't forget to teach my subordinates<03e0>that experience is just as important as book<03e0>knowledge.
Pagus. Rush. I'll be returning to Melphina,<03e0>then. Pagus<07f0>whenever you have a chance, please<03e0>come and visit.
Sibal, you'd do well to take care of yourself...<03e0>We might not be there next time you're about<03e0>to be eaten by monsters.
Alright, lad.<03e0>It's time we returned to Melphina as well.
Some giant monster's moved into the cave where<03e0>I saw the Arco Iris<07f0>and it seemed hungry.<04e0>So long as the monster's there, there's no way<03e0>we can go look for the Remnant.<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'll take care of that thing!<09e008e0010000000300>Monsters don't sound like fun...
The miners of Royotia<07f0>no slouches in the<03e0>physical power department<07f0>have tangled with<03e0>the thing more than a couple times...<04e0>They haven't won once. Don't go off half-cocked,<03e0>alright, kid? You'll regret it.
What's wrong, kid, scared of the big bad monster?<04e0>...I was, and that's why I didn't even try getting<03e0>close!
Oho, it's the kid again! I figured you an' Pagus<03e0>couldn't commit and went back to Athlum already!<04e0>Don't tell me you're gonna go back to the cave<03e0>to try and see the Arco Iris, are you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>That monster's toast!<09e008e0010000000300>(Going home sounds good.)
The miners of Royotia<07f0>no slouches in the<03e0>physical power department<07f0>have tangled with<03e0>the thing more than a couple times...<04e0>They haven't won once. Don't go off half-cocked,<03e0>alright, kid? You'll regret it.
What's wrong, kid, scared of the big bad monster?<04e0>...I was, and that's why I didn't even try getting<03e0>close!
Boy... Men who run from their challenges find<03e0>they're running from their own growth. Stop<03e0>being wishy-washy and defeat that thing!<04e0>...I'll be waiting here, where it's safe.
