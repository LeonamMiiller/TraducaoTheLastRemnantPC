Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis asked me to find<03e0>his wife, Violet. Something tells me they're not<03e0>the most loving couple in the world...
Found Violet in the Ivory Peaks, and brought<03e0>her back to the Baron. They don't talk much.<03e0>Is this what marriage is about?
I guess Violet left the Ivory Peaks and returned<03e0>to her husband.
Baron Nielsen asked me to find his wife<03e0>again<07f0>this time at the Gaslin Caves.<03e0>...If marriage is this hard, I ain't doin' it!
Violet almost killed Duke Qubine today...<03e0>Instead he made her a heroine, and now the<03e0>Gilles-Barre name is carved in history. Huh.
Paris wants me to go with him to meet his love<03e0>in the bell tower of Mojcado Castle.<03e0>I wonder where my true love is.
Someone was out to kill Paris, but we averted<03e0>the crisis and now Charlotte is back in his arms.<03e0>Good for them!
Paris hired me as a bodyguard again. I was about<03e0>to meet with him and Charlotte in the Great<03e0>Subterrane, when Charlotte was kidnapped!
We saved Charlotte, but she ended up dumping<03e0>Paris because it was upsetting her mom.<03e0>Seriously? I think it's time to leave the nest.
Balterossa and Royotia are at each other's throats.<03e0>Charlotte asked me to go with her to Royotia.<03e0>Who can say no to such a cute gal?
I went to Royotia but couldn't find Charlotte.<03e0>Too bad... I really enjoy her company.
Phew! Balterossa and Royotia made nice.<03e0>Charlotte and Paris got back together, but<03e0>they both have a lot on their plates, looks like.
Roberto of Melphina asked me to go to Crookfen<03e0>to check out the Last Leaf's seal. It broke or<03e0>something and monsters are everywhere.
Thanks to Forest Maiden Marsha, the seal<03e0>is all good. Woot! No more monsters<03e0>in that area now!
There was trouble in Crookfen, but it looks<03e0>like Roberto led the Knights of Melphina and<03e0>saved the Last Leaf without my help.
A bunch of Melphinian knights vanished,<03e0>so we headed to Siebenbur after Leticia<03e0>used her second sight to find us a clue.
We found the knights, but some idiot broke<03e0>the bridge we crossed, so we have to find<03e0>another way to get outta here.
We got rid of the danger here! We rock!<03e0>Time to head back to Melphina!
The knights were rescued from Siebenbur<03e0>and everyone went back to Melphina.<03e0>Still don't know who destroyed the bridge...
Looks like Roberto led the Order of Melphina<03e0>and saved his men without my help.<03e0>Brave guy.
Melphina was attacked by a buttload of<03e0>monsters, but we took care of 'em.<03e0>We saved the seal!
Melphina was attacked by a buttload of<03e0>monsters but we took care of 'em.<03e0>Marsha sealed the Remnant again with her prayers.
People are worried that something happened<03e0>to the Cosmos Maiden in Crookfen.
Found Sheryl, the Cosmos Maiden, in Crookfen.<03e0>I think she's a few stars short of a galaxy...
I got Sheryl safely to Nagapur.<03e0>Kosmosfest is about to start.<03e0>Fun times ahead!
Kosmosfest just started, but there are a bunch<03e0>of monsters in the area and the Maiden can't<03e0>concentrate. Time to take some action!
The Kosmosfest was a huge success.<03e0>The Syltique taught us that the world<03e0>wasn't created so we could fight each other.
Going to Dillmoor as Glenys's bodyguard.<03e0>We have the key to some underground area<03e0>that's supposed to be around there.
I found the entrance to the underground<03e0>area we're looking for! Aces!<03e0>Now we just need to get to the bottom floor.
We got to the bottom floor of Aveclyff, but<03e0>I don't see anybody. Glenys wants me to<03e0>pay attention to any weirdness around us.
The person we were looking for turned into a<03e0>monster, so we slew him and got a formation<03e0>scroll. Score! Glenys disappeared soon after that.
Glenys asked me for some help, but she<03e0>ended up going on her journey alone.<03e0>No one's seen her since.
Glenys wants us to find the Spear of Origin.<03e0>Some shady guy in Undelwalt is selling old<03e0>treasures, so I should try talking to him.
Got the scroll Snakebite from a real shady<03e0>vendor in the guild.
Got a shard formula from a real shady<03e0>vendor in Gefyri.
Got a Finsternis from a real shady vendor<03e0>in the pub.
The Spear of Origin was returned to Glenys's<03e0>hometown. Even though the town doesn't exist<03e0>anymore, its honor lives on.
Some guy in Balterossa asked me to take three<03e0>godstones to the altar of the desert tower.<03e0>Ugh, that's way out in the Great Sand Sea...
Finally reached Flaumello Tower! Time to plop<03e0>down those three rocks on the altar.<03e0>The tower is so full of history. Exciting stuff!
All three stones were offered.<03e0>I wonder what's going to happen...
We beat the Mantroskylo forces and saved<03e0>Queen Flaumello's soul. Guess this finally<03e0>is the end of the Kingdom of Glenys.
Yuniver wants me to investigate some mystic<03e0>something. It was too confusing to understand.<03e0>All I know is that it's dangerous.
Found some mystic circle thing, but it just<03e0>disappeared along with some weird gibberish.<03e0>I wonder what it was trying to point us to...
Yuniver's investigation is over. We didn't figure<03e0>everything out, but apparently, if we kept investigating<03e0>it, the world would lose its balance or something.
We beat the Fallen, some kickass monster<03e0>Wyngale was chained to. Now he's free, and<03e0>grinning like a fool. It's...actually kinda creepy...
Jorgen lost his memory, but I might be able<03e0>to help him get it back by showing him things<03e0>connected to his past.
Jorgen regained his memory.<03e0>He says he's gonna treasure it from<03e0>now on.
Loki wants me to go with him to Mt. Vackel.<03e0>We need to get some visuminsumos so<03e0>a girl he likes can get her sight back.
Reya can see now, thanks to the visuminsumos!<03e0>Loki thought his ugliness would scare her away,<03e0>but it looks like they're closer than ever.
Rhagoh from Celapaleis asked me to help<03e0>him find the goddess statue in the Robelia<03e0>Ruins so he can see his sister again.
The Remnant Collapsed and Kate came out of<03e0>nowhere. I guess she wasn't so dead after all...
Rhagoh never found the statue and<03e0>his dreams of living with his sister<03e0>were shattered.
The customization guy in Celapaleis wants me<03e0>to get him some ore while I carry around<03e0>this ugly little creature.
Found some ore! Made the customization guy<03e0>real happy. The ugly little creature likes me and<03e0>decided to stay with me and help me out.
This flamboyant white sovani wants me to<03e0>get him some white flower seeds. He says<03e0>the monsters in the Catacombs have 'em.
Got some seeds!<03e0>The white sovani seemed happy.<03e0>I still think he coulda just taken a shower.
The white sovani asked me to help him<03e0>out, but it looks like he found his own<03e0>way of cleaning himself up.
This freaky, huge white yama lost his six<03e0>treasures, and wants me to find them. They're<03e0>somewhere around the other Blackdale entrance.
The white yama went psycho on me!<03e0>He didn't even want his stuff!<03e0>And I went through all that trouble...
I was looking for the white yama's treasures,<03e0>but he wandered off somewhere without saying<03e0>anything. Guess he didn't need them after all.
A white qsiti wants me to get him the Forbidden<03e0>Tome that's been sealed for hundreds of years.<03e0>Apparently, it's in the Catacombs somewhere.
The Forbidden Tome had rotted, but I showed<03e0>the qsiti the picture of his ex-comrades and<03e0>he freaked out! I wonder where he's headed now.
I was gonna help out the white qsiti,<03e0>but I guess I was too late.<03e0>He was long gone.
This cute black-haired girl in Balterossa wants<03e0>me to get her sister, who's in Mojcado Castle<03e0>looking for something she lost.
I found Hinnah cowering from some huge bugs.<03e0>I tried to get her to leave, but she won't budge<03e0>without finding the item she lost.
Hinnah found her earring, so I took her back to her sis.<03e0>Sadly, they left afterwards, but Hannah promised a "hotter,<03e0>more intense" meeting next time...I can't wait!
I was gonna help the cute black-haired girl<03e0>find her sister, but I guess I was too late...
This shady guy came up to me and dared me to get<03e0>a Bloodsoaked Blade from a Grand Beetle in the<03e0>Great Sand Sea. Piece of cake!
It looks like I lost the dare... But the guy gave<03e0>a raincheck on that killing me stuff. Weird guy...<03e0>Says he'll see me later<07f0>not if I see him first!
The shady guy isn't in Baaluk anymore.<03e0>Does that mean I lost the dare? Oh man, he's<03e0>not really gonna try to kill me, right?
Some old guy ran off to Lavafender after a<03e0>monster that turned into a sword. He's<03e0>obviously senile. Guess I should save him...
Seems bandits are after the old dude.<03e0>What were they talking about, anyway?<03e0>What "psycho old man"?
The old dude left in pursuit of the sword.<03e0>The girl who sent me after him seemed relieved.<03e0>I wonder who he was. No one seems to know.
The old man who believed in the legend<03e0>apparently got a hold of it.<03e0>Good for him!
The Third Committee made Leithion's Sword,<03e0>a weapon that can trigger Collapses, or something.<03e0>I gotta help Duke Ghor find that sword!
Thanks to Leithion's Sword doing its Collapse thing,<03e0>there're funky rifts in space everywhere. It's gonna be<03e0>hell trying to track it down...
Duke Ghor destroyed the sword. Ha!<03e0>And he even said he's gonna help me out<03e0>if I ever need it. Aces!
Emma wants help destroying a giant in Robelia<03e0>Ruins. Seems like someone's set it up especially<03e0>so that it'll take out Athlumian soldiers...
We totally took out the giant. Too easy!<03e0>Afterwards, Emma headed to the Valeria Heart.<03e0>It looks like she's waiting for someone.
I promised to help destroy the giant in<03e0>the Robelia Ruins, but it looks like<03e0>the Athlum army already took care of it.
This Allan guy wants help destroying the Steel<03e0>Syndicate. We have to catch them in the Gaslin<03e0>Caves before they make it to Athlum!
Torgal and Allan are bummed that some people<03e0>believe violence is good. Allan left to<03e0>continue his journey for truth.
Blocter asked me to join him in the Tournament<03e0>of Heroes at the Heroic Ramparts.<03e0>We breezed through to the second round.
The second round was a joke!<03e0>Now it's time for the finals, baby!
Me and Blocter totally kicked ass!<03e0>We brought the title of Hero Exemplar home to Athlum.<03e0>Pfft, like there was any doubt!
Pagus's old friend Sibal says he caught a glimpse<03e0>of the Remnant of Miracles, the Arco Iris.<03e0>I gotta go to Royotia and talk to him.
The Remnant of Miracles, the Arco Iris,<03e0>was spotted in Siebenbur, but that place is<03e0>crawling with monsters...
Me and Pagus's friends Maddox and Sibal beat<03e0>the monsters in Siebenbur. Yes!<03e0>The Arco Iris was in their hearts... What...?
Someone challenged Emmy to a duel.<03e0>Apparently, this is something she HAS to do.<03e0>The opponent, warrior Yerva, is waiting in Aveclyff.
Gazing at the Valeria Heart's shadow, Emmy<03e0>swore to protect Athlum under the name of<03e0>Emma Honeywell. Just like her mom.
David wants me to go with him to Fornstrand.<03e0>He says he's meeting someone, but I've never<03e0>heard him mention a friend living there before.
David fulfilled his promise to his friend.<03e0>I'm glad he finally got a chance to finish<03e0>up something he's been meaning to do for a long time.
In the Celapaleis tavern, Haruko asked me to help her<03e0>find the Dead Heart, a legendary Remnant with the power<03e0>to grant wishes. Sounds like a useful trick!
I helped out Haruko and got the Dead Heart.<03e0>Her next goal is to see what we can do in order<03e0>for people and Remnants to coexist.
I went looking for the Dead Heart like Haruko<03e0>asked, but we couldn't find it. What a bummer!<03e0>Haruko ran off, looking for more Remnants, I guess.
So, to grab Blank Remnants like the Chairman says<03e0>we have to, we're gonna need some tablet thing.<03e0>Luckily, Mom says there's one in Marshallton.
I kicked the combined asses of Namul Sin and<03e0>Niram Sin and got myself a tablet. Haha!<03e0>Now I can get my hands on lots of cool Remnants!
Jager wants me to help him find the Lob Omen.<03e0>It's been spotted near Wyrmskeep, so I should<03e0>head over to the Aqueducts and make my way inside.
I found the Lob Omen in Wyrmskeep and boy,<03e0>it looked pissed! I almost had it but it just<03e0>barely got away. Dammit! I guess I'll have to keep looking.
I got the Lob Omen back. As if there was<03e0>any doubt that I could!<03e0>Jager's happy. All's good.
Nordis and Azelle have been tormenting<03e0>Melphinians. Time to follow them to Numor<03e0>Mines and kick some ass!
The lord decided to hand over the Blue Elf<03e0>in exchange for the girls' lives. Guess this was the<03e0>big revenge Azelle was going on about, huh...
Nordis and Azelle, the two who have been<03e0>tormenting Melphina, got away and even<03e0>the knights couldn't catch them... That sucks.
I destroyed the royal troop of Mantroskylo,<03e0>protectors of the ancient desert kingdom.<03e0>We'll never know its history, but at least Balterossa's safe.
Royotia's marquis, Lord Priam, wants me to<03e0>go listen to the Flame Guardian's story.<03e0>It would help if I knew who that was...
That Vespalia is trying to destroy<03e0>Royotia. I need to collect nine Crimson Shards<03e0>and make it disappear!
Vespalia was terrorizing the town, but someone<03e0>defeated it. Good news, right? Wrong.<03e0>Someone stole the Emeth Tag during all the chaos!
The Vespalia monster is dead!<03e0>Royotia's out of danger. All's good!
Vespalia's been purged. Royotia is<03e0>completely safe! The girl seemed really<03e0>happy about that before she went off somewhere.
Seems like some monster called Validus is making<03e0>trouble in the Vale of the Gods. Me and Leshau've<03e0>gotta do something about it.
Validus is toast!<03e0>Leshau told me to take a break.
With Validus gone, the Brimuslabus was<03e0>handed over to the Academy.<03e0>Hope this means Baaluk's safe!
Leshau asked me to help him slay<03e0>the monster Validus, but it looks<03e0>like he went off on his own. And failed.
This qsiti in Balterossa wants me to defeat<03e0>a monster roaming around the Great Subterrane.<03e0>It's supposed to be strong. Really strong.
I killed the monster!<03e0>The qsiti seems to think there's some kind of<03e0>conspiracy, but who cares! The important thing is<07f0>I rock!
I killed the monster and the ancient hero.<03e0>I don't know why they kept fighting all these years.<03e0>Isn't there a better way to spend time...?
The ancient hero came back as a monster.<03e0>We have to go to the Great Subterrane and<03e0>stop him before he puts Balterossa in danger.
The hero-turned-monster is done for!<03e0>Balterossa is safe. Go me!
The hero-turned-monster is dead.<03e0>No one really knows how he transformed<03e0>into that thing. Not my problem, I guess.
A lady magus wants me to recover an old treasure<03e0>from the Great Sand Sea. She also gave me<03e0>a code: C-4-B-E-A-1. I wonder what it's for.
I used the code C-4-B-E-A-1 in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea and a little kid appeared.<03e0>I think he's trying to guide me somewhere.
I brought the ancient treasure back to the lady,<03e0>but she didn't seem to want it.<03e0>I don't understand women...
Some weirdo scientist guy from Melphina<03e0>somehow conned me into going to Yvalock's<03e0>Nest to get some "special" materials.
The scientist guy must have had a real traumatic<03e0>experience, because he seemed really bummed.<03e0>I couldn't say anything to cheer him up!
The scientist guy wants to try another experiment.<03e0>He asked me to get him more materials for<03e0>an "even better" concoction.
The scientist guy got stomped by some<03e0>girls he ticked off. I didn't know what to say,<03e0>so I decided to leave him alone.
The scientist guy decided to give it one more go.<03e0>Third time's a charm, right?<03e0>I really hope he gets what he wants this time...
The scientist guy failed again...<03e0>I don't think science is the way to go...
The scientist guy couldn't create anything<03e0>useful, so he decided to go on a journey<03e0>in search of more knowledge.
Baaluk's barkeep sent me to the Salamander's<03e0>Belly to exterminate some bugs. ...Some!?<03e0>There were billions! I got the job done, though.
According to the old man, there's some shady<03e0>business going on with some sleazy dudes<03e0>into human trafficking. They're in the Aqueducts.
I destroyed the slave-trading group hiding in the<03e0>Aqueducts. The kid's sister was returned safely.<03e0>The old man gave me a reward. Life is good!
Raphus from Royotia wants me to recover<03e0>something of his that he accidentally traded<03e0>to someone named Rainn from Balterossa.
I can get Raphus's treasure for the Ancient Scabbard,<03e0>but to get that, I need the Ring of<03e0>Morning Calm from Alyssa in Baaluk.
I bought the Ring of Morning Calm from<03e0>Alyssa to trade for the Ancient Scabbard later.
I traded the Ring of Morning Calm for the Ancient<03e0>Scabbard. I should be able to take it to Beauson<03e0>in Elysion to get Raphus's treasure back.
Raphus's map was traded to a lady who<03e0>mistakenly thought it was a map to<03e0>the Imperator's treasures.
Alyssa from Baaluk had Raphus's item, but<03e0>she threw it away. She told me that it's probably<03e0>still around here somewhere.
I got Raphus's map back in Baaluk.<03e0>I should go back to Royotia and tell him.
Raphus got his map back. It just looks like<03e0>an old map that has scribbles on it, but it<03e0>has memories of his wife.
Some Athlumian merchant asked me to be the bodyguard<03e0>for a surveyor down in the Gaslin Caves.<03e0>Something about trade routes to Balterossa...
I met up with the guy trying to establish a trade<03e0>route between Athlum and Balterossa.<03e0>Now to avoid the Jhana and get out of these caves.
I escorted the guy to the cave's exit.<03e0>I helped secure the trade routes. Score!
Some dude named Baulson asked me to find some<03e0>rich sick kid who got lost in the Gaslin Caves.
I helped a kid who got jumped by some thieves<03e0>in a cave, and got a reward from Baulson.<03e0>He said he'd help out if we needed him in the future.
Rhagoh from Celapaleis wants me to find the man<03e0>who's out getting flowers for his sister's grave.<03e0>I should head to Darken Forest.
I gave Rhagoh the flowers and told him about the<03e0>girl I met in the woods. He's decided he wants to<03e0>see if it's his sister. So...she's a ghost? Or a zombie!?
Some qsiti named Darien dared me to bring<03e0>him the sacred chalice from his hometown.<03e0>Bring it on, punk! ...Wait, where is his hometown?
I found out that Darien is from Melphina. Ha!<03e0>But I have no idea where the chalice is...
I got my hands on a cracked chalice.<03e0>Is this what he was talking about?<03e0>I guess I should show it to Darien, at least.
I handed the cracked chalice to Darien.<03e0>He looked really surprised, but now he<03e0>thinks I'm cool and wants to be part of the gang.
A mysterious woman handed me a letter to<03e0>deliver to a yama in the Robelia Ruins.<03e0>Man, I'm such a sucker for a pretty lady!
The yama got the letter. My part is done!
The mysterious lady disappeared.<03e0>I wonder what she meant when she<03e0>said that I had made a difference.
I bought some dodgy "Khrynia" potions from a magus-y<03e0>girl in Athlum. She ran off right afterwards, though.
I bought some dodgy "Khrynia" herbs from a magus-y<03e0>girl lost in Celapaleis. She seriously needs a map.
I bought some dodgy "Khrynia" explosives from a<03e0>magus-y girl lost in Elysion. She ran off<07f0>hopefully<03e0>this time she'll remember her compass.
I bought some dodgy "Khrynia" lotions from a magus-y<03e0>girl hanging around the Nagapur canals. She left in<03e0>search of a peaceful place.
I bought this dodgy "Khrynia" charm from a magus-y<03e0>girl who wants to remodel Ghor Castle. I'm sure the<03e0>Duke'll love that! She left in search of a historical town.
I bought this dodgy "Khrynia" ring from some magus-y<03e0>girl with personal problems. She left Undelwalt to visit<03e0>a border town.
I bought this dodgy "Khrynia" armband from a magus-y<03e0>girl who I'm starting to think has swindled me out of way<03e0>too much cash. She left to cross the Great Sand Sea.
That magus-y girl finally got a real job! I couldn't help<03e0>but buy ore off her. But then she quit to go someplace<03e0>with a fairy-tale feel. Women, who can understand 'em?
That magus-y girl was in Melphina, bummed since she<03e0>wasn't the only magus-y type around. Then I bought<03e0>something from her. Am I an enabler?
Found that magus-y girl in Baaluk, sick of living in the<03e0>boonies. Her name's Khrynia...I can't believe I didn't figure<03e0>that one out! Anyway, she left to become a mercenary.
I helped pummel the Third Committee with Nora<03e0>to help out the Bloody Alice members.<03e0>Too bad violence can't heal wounds from the past...
The Jhana were getting out of control, so I<03e0>helped Caedmon suppress them a bit.<03e0>I think they got the hint. Hehe.
We had to suppress the Jhana again.<03e0>This time we showed them we REALLY mean business.
Getting rid of the rest of the Conqueror's army<03e0>was satisfying! The Silver Falcons rock!<03e0>Oh, and they help maintain peace in the world.
Some really gloomy guy gave me a letter to give<03e0>to someone in a pub in Balterossa. I should<03e0>take the Southwestern Road to get there.
I delivered the letter to Balterossa.<03e0>I wonder what it was about...and why<03e0>he couldn't just use a mailman.
