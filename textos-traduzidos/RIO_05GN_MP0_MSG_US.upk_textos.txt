Hey, kid. Have you been to the southern cave,<03e0>Siebenbur, yet? There're ruins a thousand years<03e0>old down there.<04e0>We mercs are regularly hired as bodyguards by<03e0>excavation groups and scholars wanting to see<03e0>the ruins.<04e0>It's not bad money, if you've got the patience<03e0>to deal with the jabbering of scholarly types.<04e0>Thing is... It's rumored there's some giant<03e0>monsters running around and breaking up the<03e0>veins of ore.<04e0>Eh, I've never come across one, but I'm sure I<03e0>could easily take down one or two single-<03e0>handed!
Finding a lode of Damascus ore is the dream of every<03e0>miner in Royotia... The ore's so valuable, finding some'd<03e0>be a one-way ticket to riches.<04e0>However, the ore is real rare, and there aren't many<03e0>folk who've found a vein. It's rumored there's some in<03e0>Lavafender, but... That's a hell of a place to dig...literally!
