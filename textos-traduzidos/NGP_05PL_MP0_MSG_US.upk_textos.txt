Welcome to Pub Drachenhauch!
Welcome.<04e0>Are you headed to Wyrmskeep?<03e0>You need to take the boat that leaves<03e0>the canal from Flussbahn.<04e0>I don't mean to be rude, but are you<03e0>an acquaintance of Lord Hermeien?<03e0>If not, you won't make it to the castle.<04e0>Commoners don't have a place on that boat.
Welcome.<04e0>The Aqueducts, you say?<03e0>There's an entrance in Sudenalm, but...<04e0>There've been monsters sightings in<03e0>that area lately, so they generally<03e0>keep that entrance locked.
Sir Zolean always frequents this establishment alone.<04e0>Up until three years ago, he used to come with a friend.<03e0>I wonder what became of him.
Nagapur's previous lord was Lord Oswald Hermeien.<04e0>He was a very generous and good man, but he suddenly<03e0>disappeared several years ago. Lord Wilfred claimed the<03e0>throne not long after.<04e0>It is only a rumor, but some say that he was set up<03e0>and thrown out of Wyrmskeep by Lord Wilfred.<04e0>I certainly hope that isn't the truth. There is nothing<03e0>uglier than a rivalry between parent and child.
In Sudenalm, you may encounter an old man with kind<03e0>eyes.<04e0>Rumor has it he knows a lot about Wyrmskeep<07f0>even<03e0>ways to get inside. I don't know if there's any truth to<03e0>that, though.<04e0>He really reminds me of somebody...<03e0>I just can't quite put my finger on who...
Barkeep, you've seen him, too, right?<03e0>I'm talking about the old man in Sudenalm.<04e0>He saved me when I almost fell into<03e0>the canals the other day.<04e0>That's when I realized, he reminds me<03e0>of someone... I just can't put my finger<03e0>on who it is...
Barkeep, you going to stay here and run the pub?<03e0>I'm going to leave town with my family.<04e0>But before I go, I wanted to tell you something.<04e0>That old man who looked familiar to me...<03e0>I finally figured out who he is.<03e0>He's the previous lord, Oswald Hermeien!<04e0>But I guess it doesn't matter now.
You've seen the Gwayn, yes?<04e0>I've seen many, many Remnants<03e0>in my time, but nothing is more<03e0>overwhelming than that one.<04e0>There's quite a powerful-looking one<03e0>in Balterossa, to the south, but<03e0>it can't possibly overshadow the Gwayn.<04e0>Lad, you should go to different<03e0>lands and see their Remnants with<03e0>your own eyes.
I never thought the Gwayn would<03e0>be capable of anything like this.<04e0>I thought it was the strongest<03e0>of them all.<04e0>Well, I suppose it proved its powers.<04e0>I just didn't think it would happen<03e0>like this...
I hear the Conqueror wants all the Remnants he can<03e0>get his hands on.<04e0>The major cities can protect themselves with their<03e0>armies, but what are the small towns to do?
I see a lot of black-hooded fellas<03e0>around the pub lately.<03e0>They're all so rude and obnoxious!<04e0>I mean, who brings a white jelly monster<03e0>to a pub!?<04e0>The other customers got scared and<03e0>they all up and left! And here I am,<03e0>cleaning up after it...
Many lost their lives in the Gwayn<03e0>debacle, and the pub has lost a lot<03e0>of customers, too.<04e0>And the ones who do come here<03e0>all look so solemn.<04e0>Though there is a silver lining to<03e0>what happened.<04e0>Ever since Lord Hermeien passed,<03e0>the black-hooded gang hasn't been<03e0>around.<04e0>Now this place will be a perfect spot<03e0>for those to mourn in peace.
The Duke of Ghor was a loyal aide to<03e0>our previous lord.<04e0>That's why when Nagapur is in trouble<03e0>his lordship comes to our rescue.
What in the God Emperor's up with this!?<04e0>Ever since the Duke of Ghor became<03e0>chairman of the Congress, the people<03e0>of Ghor Castle have been acting so pompous!<04e0>I doubt the duke will be in charge<03e0>for long, though.<04e0>That yama can't fill the shoes of<03e0>our Lord Hermeien!
Even if the Conqueror tries to invade Nagapur, the<03e0>Duke of Ghor will handle it.<04e0>Nothing's gonna happen to this town.
Hello, Rush Sykes.<03e0>I hear you are looking for a way to the Sacred Lands.<03e0>I have some information that may be of help.<04e0>Travel northeast of Nagapur to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Sixth Path of<03e0>Siebenbur<1ce0>. What you desire may be found at the end<03e0>of the road.<04e0>...<04e0>Rush, Irina.<03e0>I think of you as my own grandchildren.<03e0>Please, return safely.
Travel to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Sixth Path of Siebenbur<1ce0>.<03e0>What you desire will be at the end of the road.
It's you...<04e0>Never thought the day would come when I'd be working<03e0>for you.
You again? You know, you don't gotta spy on me all<03e0>the time. I know you haven't got anything to complain<03e0>about, 'cause I'm working hard.<04e0>And I'll continue to work hard...as long as you keep<03e0>paying me.
What, you think that if you don't keep an eye on me<03e0>I'll jump you or something? ...Pssh, whatever, man.<04e0>Seriously, that only happened once. Okay, maybe twice...
You again... You seriously need something better to do<03e0>with your time.<04e0>Aight then, lemme ask you something: what're you<03e0>fighting for? You owe that marquis something?<04e0>Nah... I can see from your face that that ain't the real<03e0>reason... Whatever. No skin off my back either way.
You again...<03e0>How about you leave me alone?
Yo...Rush, or whatever.<04e0>Whadda you think about the state of the world lately?<03e0>I'm not talking 'bout peace or war or anything, just...<03e0>Something ain't quite right, yanno?<04e0>I've been binding Remnants all my life, and it hasn't ever<03e0>felt like it's been feeling lately. It's just... I don't even<03e0>know how to describe it.<04e0>I bet that Marquis of yours is feeling it, too. You can't<03e0>be telling me you haven't noticed anything.
Something's wrong.<03e0>Maybe...Remnants aren't like I always thought they were.
The cries of Remnants...<03e0>The essence of Remnants...<03e0>Dammit! I can't deal with this anymore!<04e0>Aight, Rush, time for you to come clean on this Remnant<03e0>stuff. Howcome you can control 'em so easy when the<03e0>rest of us are bustin' our asses? What'd you do!?<04e0>...<03e0>Sorry. Didn't mean to get heated. I know you're a good<03e0>kid<07f0>look at all the friends you've got.<04e0>I just want an answer. Maybe...maybe we weren't meant<03e0>to have control over Remnants after all...
Hey, Rush, holla.<04e0>So, I decided to stop overthinking all this Remnant stuff.<03e0>All that wallowing and angsting shit, it's not my style.<03e0>So, gimme some work! I'm bored as hell!
Everything is so serene...and boring.
Days of nothingness prove that<03e0>there is peace in your life.
Whatever...
The wife of Celapaleis's Baron Nielsen<03e0>ran off somewhere. No surprise there.<03e0>They're famous for not getting along.
Isn't that exciting?
The tides of social status are nothing<03e0>compared to the current of the ocean<03e0>that is life.
What?
Someone's planning on assassinating Duke Qubine.<03e0>A suspicious woman was seen hanging around the<03e0>area, but I don't think she was questioned or anything.

Bad rumors spread like wildfire.<03e0>And yet, no one takes action.
Yeah, that's the way it usually is.
The princess of a desert kingdom is in love and<03e0>sneaks out of the castle often to meet her love.

Love is a shield? What?

...I don't get it.
In a certain moor, the Imperator used his powers<03e0>to seal the entranceway to another realm.

Isn't that exciting?

It's true with people you trust.<03e0>Others will just leave you lying on<03e0>the ground.
It seems something happened to the Last Leaf<03e0>in Crookfen. The Forest Maidens and<03e0>the knights of Melphina are taking action.
Isn't that exciting?

It's almost time for Kosmosfest, but the Cosmos Maiden<03e0>apparently hasn't arrived yet.<03e0>I hope she's safe!

Life is but a simple maze. The entrance<03e0>and exit can be placed easily, but it takes<03e0>careful designing to enjoy it.
A maze, huh? I do feel lost sometimes.
Rumor has it that the Cosmos Maiden made it to<03e0>the festival and it's about to start. But what should<03e0>be a tranquil event is always disrupted by monsters.

Tranquility and silence transform<03e0>memories into beasts.
Did something bad happen to you<03e0>in the past?
An old-fashioned woman is looking for someone to<03e0>be her bodyguard. She's in the pub in the city<03e0>with the canals.

If she needs a bodyguard, why doesn't<03e0>she just stay indoors?
The treasures from different lands presented to<03e0>the holy city were stolen! I hear they're being<03e0>sold on the black market.

You said it! That city needs to get<03e0>with the times.
Someone is looking for these three valuable stones<03e0>that have to do with the desert's past.
Isn't that exciting?

I wonder what's destined to fall<03e0>into my lap.

Why doesn't he do that then?
A notorious bandit is lurking around Athlum!<03e0>Some say he's waiting for someone.
Isn't that exciting?
One's past should not be invaded<03e0>by others' eyes. It should be passed on<03e0>through his own stories.

Isn't that exciting?
Crime is a slippery slope.<03e0>And someday, you hit rock bottom.
And getting back up that slope is<03e0>tough.
A large yama is searching for something<03e0>he lost. He's acting really weird... I wonder<03e0>what his story is.

What one loses is the mirror to his<03e0>faults.
Silly yama!
A white qsiti was seen rummaging<03e0>through books written about magick.<03e0>Some say he looks familiar...
Isn't that exciting?

Isn't that exciting?

Yup. It's not good to trust someone<03e0>who's too good to be true.
Apparently, Torgal of the Athlum generals<03e0>is touchy about his past.
