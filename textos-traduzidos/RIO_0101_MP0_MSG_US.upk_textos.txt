Hey there, buddy! This's the heart of the mining<03e0>city of Royotia, Byon Sector. There ain't much<03e0>to do, but feel free to make yourself at home.<04e0>That range of mountains over there is the Altonas.<03e0>Mt. Altona's actually a volcano, and if it ever<03e0>blew its top, we'd all be barbeque.<04e0>But it's okay, 'cause we got that big rock there<07f003e0>that's the Emeth Tag. It keeps the volcano in check.

Hey, buddy! Welcome to Byon. There ain't much<03e0>to do, but if you're looking for a miner, you're<03e0>in the right place.<04e0>Lately, the big man, Lord Priam, seems to've<03e0>come down with something... The usual<03e0>medicines and potions ain't working, neither.<04e0>All of us miners've been doing our best to<03e0>figure out how to get him better.

Hey kid, what're you doin' in Byon?<04e0>What, you been underground too long? Check<03e0>out the Altonas.<04e0>Ever since that Conqueror goon stole the<03e0>Emeth Tag, the volcano's been getting ready to<03e0>blow.<04e0>There ain't nothing we can do but get out of<03e0>its way...<04e0>You'd better get a move on too, unless you're<03e0>a fan of being roasted alive.

Psst! Boy, hey boy!<03e0>This ain't somethin' you should go blabbing all<03e0>over, but...<04e0>I hear the little Lord Paris's been makin' eyes<03e0>at the daughter of the Duchess of Balterossa.<04e0>She's a sweet li'l thing, she is, not a lick like<03e0>that harpy of a mother...<04e0>Thing is, with the trade route kerfuffle 'tween<03e0>us and Balterossa, Lord Paris can't just go<03e0>layin' down the charm, if you know what I mean.<04e0>Star-crossed lovers an' all... Can't help but feel<03e0>bad for 'em, eh?

Psst! Boy, hey boy!<03e0>This ain't somethin' you should go blabbing all<03e0>over, but...<04e0>That kerfuffle about the trade routes heated<03e0>up, and for a bit we were about to have full-out<03e0>war with Balterossa.<04e0>Oh, but here's the good part!<04e0>So, little Lord Paris and that sweet thing from<03e0>Balterossa got together and ran all the way to<03e0>the battlefield! Defused the whole situation.<04e0>Ahh, kids in love... They can change the world,<03e0>they can. I remember those days...

Psst! Boy, hey boy!<03e0>This ain't somethin' you should go blabbing all<03e0>over, but...<04e0>Ever since the Conqueror took our Emeth Tag,<03e0>our dormant volcano's been getting a lot less<03e0>dormant.<04e0>If Mt. Altona erupts, this whole place'll be<03e0>covered in lava and ash!<04e0>...Eh? That's already common knowledge?<04e0>Well. You didn't have to be so snippy about it.<03e0>Either way, I didn't get this old by standing in<03e0>the path of active volcanoes! Time for me to go!

What're you doing here, boy?

You heard about Lord Priam's sickness, right?<04e0>We been meetin' to talk 'bout it every night in<03e0>the pub after work. There's gotta be somethin'<03e0>we can do to get him well again...<04e0>Th' whole thing's just crazy, yanno? Lord<03e0>Priam's the healthiest guy in Royotia. He ain't<03e0>never been sick before, not once.<04e0>Too bad all we've figured out so far is a whole<03e0>night of drinkin' packs a punch to your<03e0>paycheck!

That bastard Conqueror stole our Emeth Tag,<03e0>but the rumor 'round the pub is that there's<03e0>somethin' worse behind Altona heatin' up...<04e0>Supposedly, like hundreds of years ago some<03e0>evil bird was sealed under Royotia, an' it<03e0>wakin' up is wakin' the volcano, too.<04e0>Sounds blazin' ridiculous, don't it? But either<03e0>way, if the volcano blows, we're all goners.<03e0>Wonder if Ghor needs any miners...
[[4th level message]](after the Remnant is stolen)
Long ago, terrible earthquakes shook the land<03e0>here every day.<03e0>It was unlivable.<04e0>One man bound himself to the Emeth Tag, and<03e0>from then on, the volcano was calm.<03e0>That man became the first ruler of Royotia.<04e0>Lord Priam, and of course, his son Paris,<03e0>are the First's direct descendants.<04e0>Lord Priam is a very disciplined and dependable<03e0>man. Conversely, Paris is sensitive and kind...<03e0>much like his mother, may she rest in peace.
[[2nd level message]]
Lord Priam's poor health is completely<03e0>unprecedented. For him to be in such a state...<03e0>could it really be due to mere illness?<04e0>It's only a rumor I picked up from the<03e0>merchants, but the rulers of other lands<03e0>have been struck by similar illnesses.<04e0>Such a thing is completely unheard of...and<03e0>crosses the line from mysterious to suspicious.<04e0>Where are you from, son? Is not your<03e0>ruler suffering as well?
[[4th level message]]
Half a year ago, a piercing shriek came from Mt.<03e0>Altona. It was like the call of a giant bird...<03e0>Directly after the volcano started to rumble.<04e0>Then a man appeared... Dressed all in red, he<03e0>came to the city and took away the Emeth Tag.<04e0>Certainly, every able man fought to try and stop<03e0>the man. But no matter how we tried, not a<03e0>single one of us could touch him.<04e0>It's so humiliating... We couldn't even protect<03e0>our own city...
[[4th level message]](after the Remnant is stolen)
Believe it or not, I haven't been spending my<03e0>years longing to chit-chat with some mitra child.
Are you truly as imbecilic as you look?<03e0>I have nothing to say to you.<04e0>Ugh, I have absolutely no idea how Torgal can<03e0>stand to live around such idiots.
I have no idea how Torgal stands to live around<03e0>such idiots without killing himself...or you.
You again?<04e0>That reminds me... The smallest of your Four<03e0>Generals was saying... "My, Allan, even though<03e0>you're sovani too, you act so differently!"<04e0>What the hell is that supposed to mean!? Trying to<03e0>insult me, is that it? That qsiti's getting too big<03e0>for its nonexistent britches, don't you think?<04e0>Next time you see that little thing, you'd better<03e0>tell him to watch his abnormally long tongue if<03e0>he wishes to keep it!<04e0>...<04e0>No. It's not worth getting this worked up over<03e0>a tiny thing like this. Just...forget about this, boy.
Rrgh... I can't let myself be baited by the words<03e0>of some pathetic qsiti...
You again.<04e0>That reminds me... I saw Torgal get angry at one<03e0>of your Four Generals...that hulking lump of a<03e0>fish-man.<04e0>And all over something as insignificant as sneaking<03e0>food. Ah, the lofty concerns of the famed Four<03e0>Generals...simpletons.<04e0>You know, I'd never seen him make such an overt<03e0>reaction before, never. In fact, the prideful bastard<03e0>would brag that only fools would show any emotion...<04e0>Good god, what in the seven hells happened to<03e0>you, Torgal!? How could you change so, you<03e0>hypocritical<07f004e0>...<04e0>Tsk...not again... Ugh, what is making me so angry?<03e0>Even he is not worth that. It must be a side-effect<03e0>of having to debase myself to talk to you!
Rrgh... I can't believe I let myself get this worked<03e0>up over Torgal, no matter how galling he acts...
Hmph, you again.<04e0>It seems that Torgal has found someone else he's<03e0>willing to confide in. Someone other than me... Well.<03e0>Fine. It's fine. I'm glad to be rid of his piddling concerns.<04e0>...What. What is that look for? Are you laughing at<03e0>me? Let's see if you're still laughing when I rip you<03e0>limb from limb!<04e0>...<04e0>...That is,<03e0>I believe now I understand why Torgal keeps you<03e0>around. You people do keep things lively, don't you?<04e0>I never felt this way when I lived apart from<03e0>you other races.<04e0>I always considered those who let themselves be<03e0>rankled by little things to be ridiculously foolish.<04e0>And yet, after having spent this time traveling<03e0>with you people, I've found myself increasingly<03e0>burdened by these...feelings.<04e0>Odd... As time passes, the less I've thought that<03e0>to be a bad thing... You people are truly the strangest<03e0>group I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.<04e0>I had planned to leave such a cloyingly buddy-buddy<03e0>group at once, but for some reason you amuse me...<03e0>Perhaps I'll stick around a bit longer.<04e0>...What's that look for? You don't like it!? Don't<03e0>think I was joking about that limb-from-limb bit.
What do you want?<04e0>I've decided I'll go with you people for a little longer.
Ah<07f0>Rush! You startled me. To be honest, I'm trying to<03e0>lay low for a bit. Could you leave me be for now?
Ehh!?<03e0>A-ahh, Rush...<04e0>...<04e0>Well, so long as we're to be fighting together,<03e0>there's no need to keep hiding this from you,<03e0>I suppose...<04e0>I don't know if you know it or not, but I was<03e0>once a general in the Celapaleian army.<04e0>I'm not the strongest of people, but my pride and<03e0>devotion to my position is still unmatched by anyone.<04e0>However...<03e0>Everything changed after...<04e0>Hum hum?<04e0>That yama over there<07f0>did he just move? He did,<03e0>didn't he? ...I'm sorry, this is all I can say for now.<03e0>Constant vigilance, after all...<04e0>For now, please let me alone.
Forgive me, Rush.<03e0>For now, please leave me alone.
Hmm...<03e0>Seems like that yama isn't here today.<04e0>Alright, then...<03e0>Let me continue from last time.<04e0>Why is it that I, a former general of the Celapaleian<03e0>army, am now scuttling about, on the run...?<04e0>It's due to the secrets I know...secrets about my<03e0>lord, Duke Qubine.<04e0>Let me tell you, life as a fugitive is not the fun that<03e0>it seems. But of late, I've been impressed by how<03e0>long I've been able to run, if I may say so myself.<04e0>I mean, the search for me is a direct order from<03e0>Duke Qubine. It is something to catch the attention<03e0>of the majority of Celapaleis's army.<04e0>Ho ho ho!<03e0>Didn't expect that, now did you!<04e0>Hwha<07f0>?<04e0>Rush<07f0>did you see that?<03e0>Just now, over there, on that wagon! That qsiti<03e0>looks mighty suspicious!<04e0>No...I had best not say anything further.<03e0>Go, get away...you don't know me.
Not now<07f0>who knows who is watching us?
Oh, Rush. Is it time to leave yet?<04e0>Lately, it seems my pursuers have increased in<03e0>number and tenacity... I'd like to avoid staying in<03e0>public places for too long if at all possible.<04e0>Hrm.<03e0>It seems as if my flight is about to come to an end...<04e0>No, no need to worry. I've no intention of giving up<03e0>now. I'll continue to run so long as my feet will move.<04e0>However... If something were to happen to me, I<03e0>want you to flee, and don't turn back. I have no<03e0>intention of causing trouble for you or Pagus.<04e0>You know, since meeting up with you all, even<03e0>these days as a fugitive have been truly enjoyable.<03e0>...I probably should speak to Sibal as well.<04e0>Alright. Go on, go on.
This time traveling with you all has truly<03e0>been enjoyable.<03e0>I should go speak with Sibal as well...
Oh, Rush!<03e0>Is it true that Duke Qubine's been struck down<03e0>by some unknown illness?<04e0>Hrn... That Conqueror...it must be his doing. In the<03e0>end, we weren't able to catch him after all...<04e0>Hm? What's that look for?<04e0>Oh, yes...forgive me.<03e0>I suppose I have some explaining to do...<04e0>In truth, I was given a special mission by Duke<03e0>Qubine<07f0>to gather information on the Conqueror.<03e0>Sadly, I was unable to find much of use...<04e0>But, I am quite an actor, hm? I had you and Sibal<03e0>all thinking I was some delusional old man, didn't I!<04e0>Ho ho ho ho ho!<03e0>Come now, don't be angry. It was a cover story...<03e0>Nothing personal, I assure you.<04e0>...<04e0>Rush. It's terrible to think of, but the Conqueror<03e0>still lives. If left to do as he pleases, the world will<03e0>once again be thrown into confusion.<04e0>I want to stop that from happening at any cost.<03e0>...Consider it the final request of an old man who's<03e0>spent the better part of his life fighting.<04e0>And, that's how things are. I hope to continue to<03e0>have your help into the future. I'm counting on you!
Oh! Hello there, Rush. Lately my pursuers have<03e0>decreased by quite a bit... I can't decide if that's<03e0>a good thing or not, however.
Hm?<03e0>A plot to tunnel beneath Ghor Castle?<03e0>Ho ho ho ho ho!<04e0>Really now, do you think the Duke of Ghor<03e0>would allow such a thing?<04e0>Goodness, Sibal has gone on about that for years,<03e0>no point in trying to change his mind now. Can't<03e0>teach old Jhana new tricks, you know?
Huh?<03e0>What're you doing here, old lady?
Wha<07f0>excuse me?<03e0>Do I even know you?
Oh, oops.<03e0>Um, I thought you were someone else...
Hmph! Make sure you have the right<03e0>person next time!
S-sorry...
Hmph... I'll let it slide this time. Of course, that's on<03e0>the condition that there's never a second.
Calling someone "old lady" is rude and inconsiderate...<03e0>especially when they aren't old!
Hm? You again.
Uh.
You don't look happy to see me.
Uh, n-no, that's not true!<03e0>Say, ol<07f0>O beautiful young maid, what're you doing<03e0>around here?
Training.<03e0>In my family, it's a rite of passage<03e0>to travel the world.
Huh... Sounds pretty tough.<03e0>Take care of yourself, okay?
Thank you.
You're not as inconsiderate as I thought.
You're looking well.
Heya, Ms. Young Maiden.
Could you please not call me that?<03e0>It sounds ridiculous, to say the least.
Well, it's not like I know your name.
Oh?
...
The name's Emmy.
Nice to meet you for real, finally.<03e0>I'm<07f001e00be00ae0>
Rush. Rush Sykes.<03e0>Right?
Wha<07f0>? How did you know!?
I have my ways.
Take care, Rush.
What's the purpose of my training?<03e0>Well...a lot of things. But in general,<03e0>training the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.
What's the purpose of my training?<03e0>Well...a lot of things. But in general,<03e0>training the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.
You're still searching for your sister, aren't you?<03e0>I wish there was something I could do to help...
You're still searching for your sister, aren't you?<03e0>I wish there was something I could do to help...
Of course I keep in touch with my family.<03e0>That's how I know about you.
Of course I keep in touch with my family.<03e0>That's how I know about you.
I thought I'd done plenty of training, but I still can't<03e0>even light a candle to Mother... But there's no way<03e0>I'm giving up now.
I thought I'd done plenty of training, but I still can't<03e0>even light a candle to Mother... But there's no way<03e0>I'm giving up now.
What? Do you need something?
What do you want?
Have you seen Lord David?<04e0>I do not feel comfortable letting him alone.<03e0>If you see him, please tell him I am looking for him.
What a troublemaker...
...
On the surface, it does not seem like this place<03e0>has changed very much...<04e0>That said, it is no place to let Lord David run about<03e0>unsupervised.<03e0>If you see him, tell him I am looking for him.
You haven't seen Lord David?
If it was only going to be stolen anyway, we should<03e0>have taken the Remnant ourselves...<04e0>...No, Lord David would never have stood for it.
Please forget I said anything.
The Remnant Ark...<03e0>Surely there must be a similar Remnant elsewhere<03e0>in the world...
I can think of nothing...
Lord David is as prepared as he can be.<04e0>All I have to do is to follow.
Ahh... What a spectacular Remnant.<03e0>It just has a certain presence, doesn't it?<03e0>I feel as if I'd never tire of looking at it...<04e0>However...<03e0>It doesn't look all that different from any<03e0>other rock, does it...
Incredible...
...
After learning of Remnants disappearing the world over,<03e0>I'd become more a bit wary, but look. This place is the<03e0>same as always...it's a small but appreciated blessing.
Yes, yes.
Then, it's just like Athlum...<04e0>The whole mood of the town is different.
What in the world is going on?
It must exist, somewhere...
Let's continue to search.
Let's finish this...learn the true ending of this tale.
Come and check out the weapons they have!<03e0>Ahh, from blunt to sharp, fancy decorative stuff<03e0>to everyday weapons, I love 'em all!
Heheheheh...
Lady Emma...
Heya, Rush! Check it out<07f0>the Remnant's still alive<03e0>and kicking!<03e0>So we can't get all down either, right?
We can't lose hope now!
Even the weapons seem kinda pooped out...<03e0>Guess it's 'coz the Remnant's gone...
Geez, even the weapons seem pooped out...
Gah, if I have to think about this Remnant stuff<03e0>any more, my head's gonna explode! You just tell<03e0>me where to go when you've figured it out, okay?
I'm ready to rock whenever!
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>Don't worry<07f0>I'll knock down anybody in our way!
What am I doing?<04e0>Just as it looks, taking a walk. As the Marquis,<03e0>I can't just roam the streets alone in Athlum<03e0>or Celapaleis...<04e0>I'm certain Torgal is having conniptions, but let's<03e0>keep this between us, shall we?
Remember, you never saw me.
It seems the Emeth Tag is still untouched...
...
Royotia as well...<04e0>Then, Athlum is not the only victim...
...
What am I rushing around for?<03e0>To be honest, I was mainly trying not to be recognized...
I hope we're not too late...
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>And we'll return together<07f0>victorious!
The town may look the same as always, but<03e0>that's only at first glance.<04e0>There's plenty of rumbling beneath the surface...<03e0>This is no time to start slacking.
This place is rotten...
They've lost their Remnant as well...<03e0>I suppose it could be just coincidence...<04e0>Certainly seems like a plot, though...
I can't believe someone isn't behind all this...
Hey now, quit playing around and help us search,<03e0>will you? There's got to be another way to get to<03e0>the Sacred Lands, but we won't find it if you don't look.
Don't worry<07f0>we'll find it.
I'll look after Lord David since she cannot...<03e0>So you'd better do the same for Irina.
