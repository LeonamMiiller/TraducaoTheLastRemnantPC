Weapons are a mirror to the soul. Likewise, a powerful<03e0>sword in the hands of an inexperienced wielder will<03e0>never reach its true potential.<04e0>Remember, young one, weapons are not just tools to<03e0>perfect techniques. They also serve to strengthen<03e0>your will.
It seems that you've finally begun to see the true<03e0>value of arts, young one. Don't be careless.
I've heard a young commander of Athlum has fought<03e0>evenly matched with the warrior Yerva.<04e0>To think that anyone here had such skill... I should like<03e0>to meet swords with him as well.
Athlum independence, ah?<03e0>If I had my choice, I'd rather the Lords get<03e0>together to bring peace to the country.<04e0>Yes, I realize that afterwards I'd be out of a job...
A final battle with the Conqueror...<03e0>It does seem that things will not come to an end<03e0>until he is defeated.<04e0>Be very shrewd in your actions<07f0>think things<03e0>through. The road to victory should open up.
