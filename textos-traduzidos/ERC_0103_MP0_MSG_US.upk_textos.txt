Are you lost?<03e0>This is Hendler, the market area.<03e0>You can find all sorts of great stuff here.<04e0>Everything's kind of expensive, but it's only<03e0>because we sell the best!<04e0>...Unlike what they sell at the frumpy shops on<03e0>Tula Street. I would stay away from that area<03e0>if I were you.<04e0>This place usually isn't so packed, but there's a<03e0>Congress meeting taking place soon. Hence,<03e0>the crowd.

Everyone's looking so down lately because<03e0>of what happened in Nagapur.<04e0>If the Conqueror's army is still out there,<03e0>Elysion will probably wind up a warzone...<04e0>...Now I'm dispirited, too!<03e0>I don't even feel like shopping anymore...

Our town has no lord. It is run by<03e0>the chairman of the Congress, a position<03e0>rotated by the representative of each land.<04e0>But in reality, the man with the most<03e0>power ends up getting the job.<04e0>The position has gone to Lord Hermeien<03e0>of Nagapur for the past few years.<04e0>Rumor has it that he's using his authority<03e0>to conduct some experiments at the Academy<07f003e0>something about creating new weapons.

Duke Ghor took over the Congress after<03e0>Chairman Hermeien's passing.<03e0>The Academy is going downhill, though.<04e0>The silver lining is the banning of Hermeien's<03e0>illegal Remnant experiments. Now they only<03e0>undertake legitimate research.

Many important folk pass though here.<04e0>Why, you ask?<04e0>The row of glamorous buildings over there<03e0>are actually embassies of each state.<04e0>Be careful<07f0>if you act too suspiciously,<03e0>they might arrest you.
The embassy big-shots are in a flurry.<04e0>Why, you ask?<04e0>Did you miss that flash of light?<03e0>I think something snuck into<03e0>the Sacred Lands!

The shop owners are down in the dumps.<04e0>Why, you ask?<04e0>The shops in this market used to be<03e0>funded by the Congress.<04e0>But now that Chairman Ghor is in charge,<03e0>the administrative types from Hermeien's<03e0>reign are gone.<04e0>Oh, well... I guess it wasn't fair that<03e0>our town was getting special treatment<03e0>in the first place.
Are you ready?<06e0000008e0000000000000>'Course!<09e008e0010000000300>Um, not just yet.
Alright. Hurry it up.<03e0>Come back to me when you're ready.
Alright. Let us leave.<04e0>Be on your toes<07f0>we're going to<03e0>encounter a lot of monsters.
Oh, it's you.<04e0>Did you want something?
I left my hometown and its dumb, outdated<03e0>traditions to come to the great city of Elysion.<04e0>With my incredible and awe-inspiring skills, I can<03e0>work as a mercenary and save up a bunch of cash<03e0>in no time!
I left my hometown and its outdated traditions<03e0>to come to the great city of Elysion.
The vow made between a maiden and a knight standing<03e0>in front of the holy chalice is a power strong enough<03e0>to protect the country.<04e0>...Or at least that's what the saps back home believe.<03e0>But not me, no way!<04e0>A true man can't buy into that kind of bullshit.<03e0>That's right<07f0>bullshit!
The vow made between two people can<03e0>be strong enough to protect a country!?<03e0>What a load of bull!
The thing is... I used to have this childhood friend.<03e0>She was a sickly little crybaby, but with a real heart of<03e0>gold. Ever since I was a kid I'd looked out for her.<04e0>And once I was old enough, we promised to make<03e0>our vow in front of the holy chalice<07f0>the vow<03e0>between a maiden and a knight.<04e0>But...okay. So, yeah, I know I'm not the classiest guy<03e0>around. And maybe I've made a few mistakes, acted<03e0>out a couple times<07f0>for good reasons, I might add!<04e0>Either way, to err is qsiti, to forgive divine, right?<03e0>Well, guess that saying's just pretty talk, 'cause<03e0>I couldn't get accepted as a knight.<04e0>I kept trying, but her illness just kept getting<03e0>worse. She died before we could make our vow.<04e0>She left this world, disappointed in me, all<03e0>because of that stupid tradition.<03e0>So I smashed the holy chalice!
I was supposed to make a vow with<03e0>a friend but she died, disappointed in me.<04e0>If there hadn't been that stupid tradition, then...<03e0>Dammit!
So... Deep down, I know that no matter how old and<03e0>stupid they may be, blaming tradition for everything<03e0>isn't right.<04e0>It was my own fault that I couldn't become a knight<03e0>before she died. I just didn't want to face the truth,<03e0>so I took it out on something else.<04e0>It just hurts so much to think of how I let her<03e0>down...<04e0>But I've gotta face my demons. I've gotta start<03e0>living a life that I can be proud of<07f0>that she would<03e0>be proud of.<04e0>Thanks for listening, Rush.<03e0>I can see clearly now.<03e0>I can't dwell on the past anymore.<04e0>I owe you one.
Rush, I'm not going to dwell on the past<03e0>anymore. I'm going to live a life that<03e0>she and I can be proud of. Thanks again!
