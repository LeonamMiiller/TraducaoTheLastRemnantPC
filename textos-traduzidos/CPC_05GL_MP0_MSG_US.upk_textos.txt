Welcome to the Sword of Three Realms.
To protect someone of my stature, obviously the most<03e0>skilled of mercenaries are necessary.<04e0>To that end, I always take advantage of the guild here.<03e0>The high prices are no trouble for me<07f0>I have enough<03e0>money to bury the entirety of Lamberro in gold! Ha ha ha!
If the hiring fees look expensive, well, there're good<03e0>reasons for that. I mean, a good merc's got a lot to<03e0>take care of. And I'm not just talking weapon skills.<04e0>Equipment, arts, grace, fancy talk... Classy people are<03e0>looking for all of that before they hire you. It's kinda<03e0>annoying...and pricey to keep up.
