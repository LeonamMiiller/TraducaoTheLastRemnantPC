Hey, sport, how's it going?<03e0>Better than me, I hope.<03e0>Business is terrible!<04e0>Here's a cup of Melphina's finest tea<03e0>on the house.<03e0>So as I was saying, business is in the dumps...
See all these bugs flying around?<03e0>Annoying little buggers...<04e0>By the time I bring the customers their drinks, a few<03e0>are already floating belly-up in their coffee cups.<04e0>Oh, don't worry. There weren't any floating around in<03e0>yours. I picked them all out... Er, I mean, I saw some,<03e0>so I poured you a new cup, that's it.<04e0>A bunch spawned in the <1be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Tail<1ce0> area of the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Great Sand Sea<1ce0>, and they're all drifting this way for<03e0>some reason.<04e0>It would really help me out if someone went to the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Tail<1ce0> and destroyed the hive.<03e0>Otherwise, I'm gonna be out of business soon!<06e0000008e0000000000000>Squashing bugs, huh? I'm in.<09e008e0010000000000>I'm insectophobic.
Really!?<03e0>Thanks! You're a savior.<04e0>And FYI, the bugs in the <1be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Tail<1ce0> are big<03e0>enough to swallow you whole. Stay safe out there!
A bunch of bugs have spawned in the <1be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Tail<1ce003e0>area of the <1be0ffbe34ff>Great Sand Sea<1ce0>. It would really help me<03e0>out if you went out there and destroyed the hive.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Extermination, I can do.<09e008e0010000000300>I'm insectophobic.
Heya, sport!<03e0>You totally helped me out. I really appreciate it!<04e0>Of course things being smooth sailing from there<03e0>would be too good to be true. When it rains it pours,<03e0>right? You wouldn't believe what's happened to me now...<04e0>...What? You don't want to hear any more of my<03e0>problems?<04e0>Oh...okay...
