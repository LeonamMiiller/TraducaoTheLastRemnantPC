Once upon a time, in a tiny little podunk town,<03e0>there was an orphaned qsiti and mitra.<04e0>The kindly villagers all helped to raise the kids.<03e0>But as the pair grew, they got bored with their<03e0>peaceful village, and left to find their fortune.
Out in the real world without money or power,<03e0>they somehow found themselves working for<03e0>a shady organization.<04e0>And not just any mob, but a huge organization<03e0>dedicated to the development of Remnants as<03e0>weapons. You know the one.
But the jobs they were being assigned<03e0>offered lower and lower chances of coming<03e0>back alive.<04e0>Tired of an occupation that lowered one's life<03e0>expectancy, the pair went to hand in their<03e0>resignations. Their boss replied like so:<04e0>"For a long, long time, the Organization has<03e0>wanted to test the purification Remnant, the<03e0>Blue Elf," he said with a smirk.<04e0>"If you bring us the Remnant, the two of you are<03e0>free to go." And those "two" were... Well, it's<03e0>pretty obvious, isn't it? Azelle and me.
Hey, don't get me wrong. I'm not telling you<03e0>this in some bid for sympathy.<04e0>I'm not letting you guys leave here alive.
Just wanted you to realize that no matter how<03e0>low a man's fallen, he'll shoulder any burden<03e0>to be free.
Welp, that's enough yapping.<04e0>Nordis of the Third Committee is going to<03e0>finish you off, right here!
Azelle, get out of here...<03e0>Run...run far.........
Augh! Bro<07f0>Nordis!!!
No...no! NO!!!<04e0>This wasn't supposed to happen!
D-dammit! We were almost home... Nordis and<03e0>me were just gonna go back home, and<03e0>everything was gonna be okay, like it used to...
This is all your fault!<03e0>Because of you, I'll never see my brother again!<04e0>N-never...
Remember how I feel...<03e0>Someday, you'll feel this sadness for yourselves!<04e0>You will...I'll make sure you will!
Damn, he got away...!<04e0>What could that Azelle be planning? We'll have<03e0>to keep on our toes.
Ahh, at least we were able to bring one of<03e0>them to justice. Halfway done, right?<04e0>For now, let's report to Commander Roberto.<03e0>I'm certain he'll be pleased to hear this.
