Hey, you been keepin' up with that Conqueror<03e0>guy an' his army?<04e0>They're just a bunch o' thugs that'll do<03e0>anything to get hold of a Remnant... Bet they'd<03e0>sell their mama for somethin' cheap, too!<04e0>Talking 'bout them's all the rage here<07f0>some<03e0>say they even wanna take over the world!<03e0>They're a shady bunch, that's fer sure!

Damn that Conqueror!<03e0>Takin' away our Lady Emma an' the Valeria Heart...!<04e0>Without 'em, the whole town's become greyer...<03e0>Dammit!
Huhhh, so is that Conqueror bastard really<03e0>s'posed to be dead?<04e0>Rumor is, his army wasn't completely<03e0>destroyed... Damned if there's anything I<03e0>wouldn't rather hear, though.
Hey, didja hear? Athlum's finally got free from<03e0>Celapaleis!<04e0>'S been a long time since we had any good news.<03e0>Kinda feels like karma's finally payin' us back!
If Lord David's goin' toe-to-toe with this Conqueror<03e0>guy, the outcome's already decided!<04e0>Yeahhh, that guy can bring it all he wants<07f0>he's just<03e0>gonna get beat down! Tear 'im a new one for Lady Emma!
Equipment shops, item shops, customization<03e0>shops...<04e0>Xiphos Way has it all.<03e0>This is the place in Athlum to shop!

The Valeria Heart was lost, and with it,<03e0>everyone's hopes... People walk down the<03e0>streets like they haven't a friend in the world.<04e0>But...this is no time to wallow in sadness!<03e0>Squeezing out a smile is the job of a merchant,<03e0>isn't it?<04e0>What we've got to do is make lots of top-quality<03e0>weapons and armor, as if to say "take that,<03e0>Conqueror!"
Ever since Duke Ghor became chairman of the<03e0>Congress, supply patterns have changed a lot!<04e0>I guess all the stuff that used to be saved especially<03e0>for Nagapur is being routed to other cities.
To think, Athlum's become an independent state!<04e0>You see the people walking around? Compared to before,<03e0>it's like night and day. Everyone's so full of hope...<04e0>Looks like they'll be in the mood for buying, too,<03e0>which makes me happy!
Ignoring the God Emperor's orders and fighting the<03e0>Conqueror... I can't quite say that I think it's a good thing<03e0>or not.<04e0>But...I trust Lord David. He's not gonna steer us wrong!<03e0>The rest of us shopkeepers, too, of course! Good luck,<03e0>Athlum!
That large sword is this town's Remnant. It's looked<03e0>after the people of this town for centuries, you know.<04e0>When I was just a little girl and I was feeling down,<03e0>I'd go out to the Town Square.<04e0>It sounds strange, but just looking at the Remnant<03e0>always made me feel better.
Some men calling themselves "the Conquerors"<03e0>or something are plotting to attack the city, I heard...<03e004e0>That's so silly, isn't it? We've got the Marquis<03e0>and the generals to take care of us. Plus, the<03e0>Valeria Heart will protect us, no matter what.<04e0>Whoever these guys are, who cares? They can't do<03e0>anything, so it's not even worth worrying about.
The sword...it's gone.<03e0>I can't stop looking up, it's force of habit...<03e0>but there's nothing there.<04e0>What's going to happen to us?
I heard the army's supposed to be finding some<03e0>new Remnant to replace the Valeria Heart.<03e0>Like anything could!<04e0>Besides... I've already gotten used to seeing<03e0>the sky without it...
Have you heard? Athlum's become independent of<03e0>Celapaleis.<04e0>It warms me to hear it... Even though the Valeria Heart<03e0>is gone, it still watches over us...
The Athlumian Guard will march on the Conqueror's<03e0>army... I truly hope everyone can return safely.<04e0>Somehow, the Valeria Heart will look over them, I'm<03e0>sure of it...
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...<04e0>You there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah...why?<09e008e0010000000000>You're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
*snort* Playing dumb won't get you anywhere<07f0>if you're<03e0>playing at all.<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...<04e0>You're Rush Sykes, right?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup, I'm Rush!<09e008e0010000000000>Who, me? Couldn't be!
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.<04e0>He says he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>information-gathering, and that you should come to<03e0>the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> for details.<04e0>Got it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,<03e0>though<07f0>you're not in trouble...not with us at least.<03e0>Lord David's put out a summons for you.<04e0>Apparently he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>your information-gathering, so he'd like you to come<03e0>to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> so he can share it with you.<04e0>Don't make him wait too long, okay, kid? Or else you<03e0>might end up in trouble with us after all... Just joking!
Ohh! That valiant form...<04e0>You must be Rush Sykes, are you not?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The one and only!<09e008e0010000000000>Depends on who's asking.
Well met!<03e0>David, Marquis of Athlum requests that you come<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Athlum Castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!<03e0>I bring a message from Lord David. He requests that<03e0>you come to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Sorry, man, I'm still setting up.<04e0>When'll I be open?<03e0>Huh, good question!

This is the Town Square, where the proud people of<03e0>Athlum come to relax and unwind.<04e0>Anything you need from accessories to weapons can<03e0>be acquired here.<04e0>I recommend you take a look around.
The soldiers who went to the Robelia Ruins still<03e0>haven't returned... If only Lady Emma could investigate...
What's wrong? You look lost. If it's information you need,<03e0>check out the <1be0ffbe34ff>pub<1ce0>. If you're looking to expand your party,<03e0>check out the <1be0ffbe34ff>guild<1ce0>.
Facing the Conqueror was like gnats trying to<03e0>take down the Gwayn. We were completely<03e0>overwhelmed...<04e0>At the very least, I can stand watch over the<03e0>square that Lady Emma gave her life to protect.
The Congress has reconvened, and Lord David<03e0>is busy searching for new Remnants.<04e0>The merchants here are doing their part as<03e0>well<07f0>mobilizing through stocking all-new<03e0>inventory.
Everyone's saying that Athlum getting its independence<03e0>is all thanks to the hard work Lord David's been doing.<04e0>That being the case, I'm going to do my best to<03e0>uphold the pride of Athlum by watching over this square!
I wanted to help out with the strike against the<03e0>Conqueror as well...<04e0>But someone had to protect the Town Square...<03e0>I'll do what I can from here, so I'm depending on you<03e0>guys to take care of the rest!
You must be Rush Sykes.<03e0>I've heard a lot about you from Lord David.<04e0>Everyone's quite the oddball, but they're all<03e0>good men. If you're ever in need of help,<03e0>you know where to find it.
This Remnant is the heart of our town.<03e0>It's called the Valeria Heart.<03e0>It represents bravery.<04e0>Long ago, this town was victim to many disasters.<04e0>But one day, a massive sword fell from the sky, and<03e0>from that moment on, nothing else troubled the<03e0>land...or so the legend goes.<04e0>Thus, as long as the Valeria Heart exists,<03e0>Athlum will not fall.<04e0>If you are ever discouraged, pray to the Valeria Heart.<03e0>Your spirit will be set at ease.
Lately, it seems there are many tales of a brute<03e0>calling himself the Conqueror making trouble...<04e0>It's nothing to worry of here in Athlum.<03e0>Trust in the Valeria Heart.<03e0>We have nothing to fear.
[[3rd Level Message]]
The Valeria Heart was taken from us...<04e0>But, the Remnant was meant to protect us from all<03e0>evils threatening us. That...that couldn't have been<03e0>mere superstition...
From the merchants, I hear that Nagapur has been<03e0>destroyed.<04e0>I've lived my life thinking of Remnants like guardian<03e0>angels here to protect us. Now, I'm not so certain...
I never imagined I would live to see the day Athlum was<03e0>under her own control...<04e0>Indeed, there is more to life than suffering.
I can only pray that we'll all get through this safely.
Athlum's ruler, Lord David, genuinely cares about his<03e0>people and listens to our needs with a caring heart.<04e0>The former Marquis died when Lord David was still<03e0>really young, but even so, he's grown to be a great<03e0>ruler in his own right!<04e0>He's even bound the strongest weapon in all of Athlum,<03e0>the Gae Bolg. I can't think of anyone who'd be more<03e0>appropriate for the job.
Hey... This isn't common knowledge, but I can tell you're<03e0>into the Marquis as much as I am, so I'll let you in on it...<04e0>They say that each time the former Marquis used the<03e0>Gae Bolg in battle, it ate away a little bit of his soul!<03e0>That's why he died so young.<04e0>Now, Lord David is working hard and fighting to protect<03e0>all of us... Who knows how much damage it's doing?<04e0>I really hope that peace is reached quickly, so Lord<03e0>David can return to us with both body and soul intact!
Before General Honeywell...before we lost her, she was<03e0>always at Lord David's side. They must have shared a<03e0>deep bond...<04e0>Now that she's passed on, who knows how painful this<03e0>all must be for Lord David?<04e0>I wonder if there's anything I could do to ease his pain...
Even after losing the Valeria Heart and Lady Emma,<03e0>Lord David hasn't missed a beat, going out to the<03e0>battlefield and leading the troops.<04e0>It's moving, isn't it? He's going to lead Athlum to a<03e0>bright future, I just know it.
Now that Athlum's reached independence, it means Lord<03e0>David will have to take on a huge responsibility...<04e0>But I'm sure he can handle it. He could even surpass<03e0>the late Marquis in greatness... With Lord David at the<03e0>helm, Athlum's future is shining bright, no doubt about it!
War with the Conqueror... No doubt Lord David only came<03e0>to this decision after a long period of heavy thought.<04e0>All I can do now is trust in him, and hope that he can<03e0>take care of this quickly and safely, so we can put this<03e0>all behind us and move to a new future.
That strike on the monsters on the Yamarn Plain was a<03e0>big success. Lord David and his Gae Bolg knocked off<03e0>those monsters in one fell swoop!<04e0>Yep yep, no one can stand up to good ol' Athlum!<04e0>Heck, I think this calls for a celebration!<03e0>Hey, pops! Gimme a cut of your finest meat!
Oh man... Everyone around here's been gabbing non-stop<03e0>about some ominous-sounding guy called the Conqueror<03e0>or something.<04e0>Apparently he's going around and attacking countries<03e0>left and right! Who knows how much longer before we<03e0>get dragged into it...<04e0>Hey, pops! Get me something healthy...<03e0>I think I'm gonna need it!
Unbelievable!<03e0>Lady Emma...dead!?<04e0>How could that even happen? Athlum's Four Generals<03e0>are the strongest fighters there are... Right, pops?
So, word is that that new Congress chairman, Ghor or<03e0>whatever, he's told Lord David to go off to find more<03e0>massive Remnants.<04e0>Seriously, are you just supposed to be stumbling over<03e0>them as you walk down the street?<04e0>If they were that easy to find, you'd see them in shops<03e0>down here all the time, eh, pops?
Lord David is just amazing! I can't believe he really got<03e0>independence for Athlum!<04e0>Pops, gimme your finest cut of meat! We're feasting<03e0>tonight!
Conqueror Schmonqueror, who's afraid of that cheese-<03e0>head? Not us! Nobody puts Athlum in a corner!<04e0>Awright, just in case, I'd better get in fighting-fit<03e0>condition myself. Pops, I don't care what you give me,<03e0>but make it something to pump me up!
I'm not gonna move<07f0>even if you ask me to!<03e0>This's my favorite spot in town... I feel so close<03e0>to the Valeria Heart<07f0>it's almost like we're one.
I thought I could depend on those guys...<04e0>Shoulda just done it myself from the beginning.
But look how far I got on my own...<04e0>I guess... I guess I DO need other people's help...
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...<04e0>You there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah...why?<09e008e0010000000000>You're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
*snort* Playing dumb won't get you anywhere<07f0>if you're<03e0>playing at all.<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...<04e0>You're Rush Sykes, right?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup, I'm Rush!<09e008e0010000000000>...No?
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.<04e0>He says he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>information-gathering, and that you should come to<03e0>the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> for details.<04e0>Got it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,<03e0>though<07f0>you're not in trouble...not with us at least.<03e0>Lord David's put out a summons for you.<04e0>Apparently he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>your information-gathering, so he'd like you to come<03e0>to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> so he can share it with you.<04e0>Don't make him wait too long, okay, kid?

Ohh! That valiant form...<04e0>You must be Rush Sykes, are you not?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The one and only!<09e008e0010000000000>Depends on who's asking.
Well met!<03e0>David, Marquis of Athlum requests that you come<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Athlum Castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!<03e0>I bring a message from Lord David. He requests that<03e0>you come to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Oh, hey there.<04e0>Not to be brusque, but I've got a few things to take<03e0>care of, if you'll excuse me.
Hey there, Rush. You know, I've got a little sister too.<03e0>She's livin' here in Athlum... It inn't so bad workin' all<03e0>the time, since I know she's here waitin' for me.<04e0>That's why I always buy little trinkets with my wages...<03e0>They're presents for her. I always keep my eye out for<03e0>things she might fancy.
I've got a little sister as well. She loves it when I bring<03e0>her presents from my travels, so I always make sure<03e0>to get her somethin' nice.
Ahh... Bein' back in the Square really takes me back<03e0>to when I was just a lad...<04e0>When I was young, I'd run in with a bad crowd, y'might<03e0>say. Spent my time picking fights, making trouble. Me an'<03e0>the gang would loaf around the square here for hours..<04e0>Heh, prolly sounds strange to wax poetic on bein' a<03e0>delinquent, eh? My folks died in the war...thinkin' back,<03e0>I guess I was lonely...any family would do.
When I was a lad, I was a right little hooligan, I was.<03e0>Spent my days picking fights an' starting trouble.<03e0>Now I get paid to stop trouble...heh.
Ahh, Rush. Can I talk to you for a minute?<03e0>Recently, my sis's been acting strange. I bring her<03e0>presents like always, and she doesn't seem to care.<04e0>I wonder... I reckon she still hasn't forgiven me...<04e0>...<04e0>I told you how I used to be a bit of a hooligan, right?<03e0>It's a bit more serious than that. 'Cause back then,<03e0>I did something really, truly bad.<04e0>Every day I'd go out running with the gang. My sis<03e0>was just a baby, but I'd leave her all alone at home.<03e0>And one day, the beastmen invaded...<04e0>I ran home as quick as a wink, but it was too late.<03e0>My sister was lying there, both her legs crushed.<04e0>The only responsibility I had in the world was to take<03e0>care of my sister, but when she really needed me, I<03e0>failed her... I might as well have cut off her legs myself.<04e0>After that I swore to get on the straight and narrow.<03e0>Started working as a mercenary to make a little money...<03e0>Hoped to buy things to make her life a little brighter.<04e0>I just don't seem to be makin' any progress. I'm at a<03e0>loss, Rush, I just don't know what to do...
The only thing I had left in the world was my sister,<03e0>but I wasn't even with her when she needed me...<03e0>I might as well have cut off her legs myself...
Oho, heya, Rush.<04e0>After we talked before, I visited my sister. Didn't have<03e0>the foggiest what to do or say to make amends, so I<03e0>ended up gabbing on about my travels and such.<04e0>Beautiful vistas, fearsome beasts, good friends...<03e0>You know, all the things what goes along with a<03e0>journey.<04e0>Figured I'd be borin' her, but I look up an' she's staring<03e0>at me, eyes are sparkling, all "finish the story!" You don't<03e0>know how long it's been since I'd seen her that happy...<04e0>That's when it hit me...I'd been going about it all wrong.<03e0>I'm trying to charm my sis with money and material<03e0>things... That's not what she wanted at all.<04e0>Thinking back, it's so obvious it's staring me in the face.<03e0>I can't help but feel like a bit of an ass...<04e0>Rush, might not sound like much, but I was finally able<03e0>to start making amends for what I've done.<04e0>So... How do I put this...<03e0>I'll be depending on you from now on.<03e0>She likes the stories with you in 'em the best, after all.
Hey there, Rush. How's it going?<04e0>I was telling my sister about our travels, and she<03e0>seems to have taken a liking to General Blocter...<04e0>Sure he's a good guy and all, but as her brother, I'm<03e0>not sure how I feel about that...
Sorry, dearie, I'm still setting up shop.<04e0>It's taking a long time to hear back from my suppliers...<03e0>Ahh, living in such a rural area makes it tough to keep<03e0>things stocked!

To think that one man could throw all of Athlum into<03e0>such chaos... Yet that's just what that Conqueror<03e0>person's done.<04e0>The toughs who usually lurk in the back alleys saw him<03e0>and ran off crying!<04e0>...I suppose I did the same thing.
Walking the streets here, all you hear are voices of<03e0>unease. And people say it's because the Valeria Heart<03e0>is gone... What's that all about!?<04e0>Are we supposed to be such superstitious old biddies<03e0>that we can't have any confidence of our own?<04e0>Our strength doesn't come from any Remnant<07f0>it<03e0>comes from ourselves!<04e0>...Well, that's what the bartender was going on about<03e0>earlier, anyhow.
Athlum's independent... I don't see how that's<03e0>supposed to change anything for me, but if everybody<03e0>else is celebrating, I might as well join in, right?
Lord David's gonna challenge the Conqueror!?<04e0>Well...I guess a jerk like that can't be left to do whatever<03e0>he pleases, he's gotta be smacked down and put away<03e0>for good! I'll be rooting for our boys!
Historically, there's been a lot of tectonic activity<03e0>around here. That's why there're so many caves in the<03e0>area.<04e0>It's only thanks to the Valeria Heart that the ground<03e0>beneath Athlum is stable.

It's said the Conqueror's army comes from far to the<03e0>east, a land called Veyriel.<04e0>It's a place so remote, they don't even have cities<07f003e0>just scattered collections of shacks.<04e0>For someone from a place like that to be able to<03e0>overwhelm Athlum so easily...<04e0>What sort of person is that Conqueror anyhow?
Now that Duke Ghor has become chairman of the<03e0>Congress, the search for new Remnants has been going<03e0>with full force.<04e0>Along the way, people have found all sorts of previously<03e0>undiscovered areas.
Now it goes to the northern shore!<03e0>I knew everything was connected somehow...<04e0>What am I talking about? Siebenbur, what else?<03e0>They've found another entrance at the northern<03e0>shore.
It seems that Duke Qubine has recognized Athlum's<03e0>independence. I wonder what machinations went on<03e0>behind the scenes to make him agree?
Hmm... It's true that if the Conqueror is left to his own<03e0>devices, he'll certainly cause trouble, or possibly do<03e0>something else terrible...<04e0>But he has the God Emperor's backing. I certainly hope<03e0>this doesn't come back to haunt us...
Lord David's Remnant, the Gae Bolg, is incredibly<03e0>powerful...but using it comes at the cost of the life of<03e0>the person it's bound to.<04e0>We probably haven't noticed it thus far, but perhaps the<03e0>use of all Remnants comes at a certain price...
[[2nd level message]]
Everyone in this city has experienced suffering at one<03e0>point or another, but now, without the Valeria Heart, it all<03e0>seems so much worse.<04e0>Maybe...maybe we're being tested<07f0>to see if we can live<03e0>without Remnants.<04e0>I don't know what the future holds, but we've got to at<03e0>least give it a try, don't you think?
So, it seems the Congress has delegated people to find<03e0>new Remnants to replace those stolen by the Conqueror.<04e0>And now that everyone knows what the Gwayn did to<03e0>Nagapur...<04e0>Fools! Are they looking for a repeat of that performance<03e0>across the continent?
An independent Athlum... I still can't believe it.<04e0>However, the tough part is yet to come... For better or<03e0>for worse, we'll all have to gird ourselves and work<03e0>together.
Why is it that the only thing people can ever decide<03e0>on is war?<04e0>I want to believe in Lord David, I really do, but I can't<03e0>help but think he's making a foolish decision...
Oy. Ya better watch yer step around this part o' town...<03e0>Ya might find people ain't so nice ta kids what look like<03e0>they got a bit o' coin.<04e0>'Course, Lord David's cleaned most o' the real bad<03e0>trash out of town. But ya still can't be too careful.
Word on the street is that people're hosin' themselves<03e0>over some Conqueror guy what's been terrorizin' cities<03e0>like it's going out of style.<04e0>What spineless nose-pickers! If that big blond douche<03e0>tries coming to Athlum, I'll kick his ass so hard he'll<03e0>feel it from the front!
*sob* ... *sniffle*<03e0>Lady Emma...<03e0>S-she covered us so we could get away...<04e0>An'-an' then, the Valeria Heart came whipping down from<03e0>the sky... I-I think I had an accident...
Shit, just 'cuz the Valeria Heart's gone don't mean the<03e0>town's got to be all doom and gloom and destruction or<03e0>whatever.<04e0>Lord David's already findin' us a new symbol, right?<04e0>So, I was thinking I should help out, an' go find one too.<04e0>Then won't nobody have a thing to worry about.<03e0>I could find us a new Remnant in a hot minute!
Independence? Meanin'...<04e0>...Ohh...meanin' those turdholes in Celapaleis won't be<03e0>able to get away with lookin' down their noses at us<03e0>anymore! Yeahhh, eat it, bitches!
The Conqueror, eh? Kick that old bitch's can until<03e0>he cries!
The soldiers who went to the Robelia Ruins still<03e0>haven't returned... If only Lady Emma could investigate...
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...<04e0>You there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah...why?<09e008e0010000000000>You're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
*snort* Playing dumb won't get you anywhere<07f0>if you're<03e0>playing at all.<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...<04e0>You're Rush Sykes, right?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup, I'm Rush!<09e008e0010000000000>Nope, I'm, uh, someone else.
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.<04e0>He says he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>information-gathering, and that you should come to<03e0>the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> for details.<04e0>Got it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,<03e0>though<07f0>you're not in trouble...not with us at least.<03e0>Lord David's put out a summons for you.<04e0>Apparently he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>your information-gathering, so he'd like you to come<03e0>to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> so he can share it with you.<04e0>Don't make him wait too long, okay, kid? Or else you<03e0>might end up in trouble with us after all... Just joking!
Ohh! That valiant form...<04e0>You must be Rush Sykes, are you not?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The one and only!<09e008e0010000000000>Depends on who's asking.
Well met!<03e0>David, Marquis of Athlum requests that you come<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Athlum Castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!<03e0>I bring a message from Lord David. He requests that<03e0>you come to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Sorry, hon, we're still getting ready. I really wanted to<03e0>have something for our troops to use before they march...<04e0>*sigh* The best-laid plans, you know?
The hell do you want?<04e0>Don't you know who I am? If we don't got business<03e0>then you'd better leave me the hell alone.
You ever heard of the savage mountain bandit<03e0>Loki? The one yer ma talked about along with<03e0>the boogeyman? That's me.<04e0>I'm trash, alright? A bad guy. Get seen talking to<03e0>me and your precious reputation'll be ruined.<04e0>Get it? Stay the hell away from me.
I'm the mountain bandit Loki, get it? A bad guy.<03e0>If you value what's dear to ya, you'll stay the hell<03e0>away.
When I was born, a huge disaster hit my<03e0>village. The whole place was almost destroyed.<04e0>Everyone in town said I was cursed...said all I<03e0>could do was bring bad luck. Only a baby and<03e0>they completely loathed me.<04e0>So I grew up, and I hated them right back,<03e0>every last damned person in that village.<04e0>I beat 'em up, cursed 'em out... By the end,<03e0>even my own ma couldn't stand me...
From the day I was born, the people in my village said<03e0>I was cursed. Every damned person in that town<03e0>hated my guts. Even my own ma...
So I left the village, and started making a name for<03e0>myself as the fierce bandit Loki.<04e0>Killing people, hunting 'em down, hating them...<03e0>Every day, that's all I did. And that was all I wanted<03e0>to do.<04e0>But one day I met this kid...<03e0>Frackin' changed everything.<04e0>I'm finishing up a job<07f0>casing this house<07f0>when<03e0>I realize there's a little girl there. I don't screw<03e0>around, I go on and pull my knife.<04e0>But right at the part where they usually start<03e0>screaming and wailing, she pops out and says hi,<03e0>all cheery-like.<04e0>Says she just wants to talk...says she wants to be<03e0>friends. Turns out the girl's blind.<04e0>'Course, I didn't believe it at first. I figured she was<03e0>like the rest, tryin' to pull one over on me. But turned<03e0>out she just wanted a friend.<04e0>It was the first time that'd ever happened...the<03e0>first time I'd come across someone who was<03e0>actually happy I was there. The first and only...<04e0>I mean, hell, my own parents don't want shit to do<03e0>with me, and this random little girl<07f0>Reya's her<03e0>name<07f0>wants to be pals. Ain't that a trip...<04e0>...Seriously, she saved me.<03e0>Who knows what I woulda become...<04e0>That's why I been searching for something to fix her<03e0>eyesight all this time. She's done so much for me...<03e0>I wanna at least try to pay her back.
There ain't a single person in the world who's wanted<03e0>anything to do with me but Reya. That's why I been<03e0>looking for something to fix her eyesight...I owe her.
Guess I owe ya one, Rush.<04e0>My eyes work fine, but my heart wasn't letting 'em see<03e0>worth a damn. All I'd ever see was darkness and pain.<04e0>It's only thanks to Reya that I been able to clear some<03e0>o' that darkness away...her an'...<04e0>Huh. It's funny how easy it is to find friends.<03e0>You just gotta open up a little.
You again. 'Sup.

Weapons are a mirror to the soul. Likewise, a powerful<03e0>sword in the hands of an inexperienced wielder will<03e0>never reach its true potential.<04e0>Remember, young one, weapons are not just tools to<03e0>perfect techniques. They also serve to strengthen<03e0>your will.
It seems that you've finally begun to see the true<03e0>value of arts, young one. Don't be careless.
I've heard a young commander of Athlum has fought<03e0>evenly matched with the warrior Yerva.<04e0>To think that anyone here had such skill... I should like<03e0>to meet swords with him as well.
Athlum independence, ah?<03e0>If I had my choice, I'd rather the Lords get<03e0>together to bring peace to the country.<04e0>Yes, I realize that afterwards I'd be out of a job...
A final battle with the Conqueror...<03e0>It does seem that things will not come to an end<03e0>until he is defeated.<04e0>Be very shrewd in your actions<07f0>think things<03e0>through. The road to victory should open up.

This is a <1be0ffbe34ff>guild<1ce0>. Sorry, the person in charge<03e0>isn't here right now.<04e0>Try back later.
What's this? Don't tell me a kid like you's<03e0>trying to take on some guild tasks! You're<03e0>greener than a seasick piece of broccoli!<04e0>Gahahah, impossible, you'd never make it!<04e0>These aren't for kiddies who're gonna get beat<03e0>up by monsters and go home crying to mommy!<03e0>Save yourself the trip and go home now.
Guild tasks?<03e0>There're all types...from simple stuff to<03e0>really hairy jobs.<04e0>Ehh, if you've got the time, then take a look,<03e0>maybe take one or two, then you'll see.
Hey, kid, have you heard? Some guys who're the<03e0>tippy-top rank of warriors've started up their own<03e0>little guild.<04e0>They say there's a secret passageway in through the<03e0>back of Warrior's Honor or something...
Independence? Yeah, yeah, it's great, I'm sure.<03e0>I'm more interested in guild tasks.
Conqueror? Oh yeah, he's a troublemaker, yeah.<03e0>I'm kinda more interested in guild tasks, though.
What's wrong, Junior, you lost? This is a guild,<03e0>a place for veteran adventurers to gather.<04e0>It's no place for fresh-faced kids who barely<03e0>know how to hold a blade. Run on home and<03e0>play stickball or something.
If you're looking for something to do, then the<03e0>guild's the right place to be.<04e0>And I'm not talking charity work. You can get a<03e0>nice reward by picking up the right task.<04e0>Well, it's not like they aren't getting anything<03e0>out of it.

Welcome, traveler, to the Warrior's Honor!<03e0>Go on and make yourself comfortable.
Welcome to the Warrior's Honor! ...He-llo, you aren't<03e0>a familiar face. And trust me, I'd remember a...face<03e0>like yours. You must be new to Athlum, hmm?<04e0>So I want you to know, if you have aaany questions<03e0>at all, come straight to me. I can give you a...personal<03e0>tour.<04e0>...<04e0>Whaaat, you're trying to meet Lord David? Well, he<03e0>receives visitors in <1be0ffbe34ff>Athlum Castle<1ce0>, that's further into<03e0>the city. <04e0>That said, it's not like just anyone can walk in and<03e0>get an audience. Of course, for a cutie like you, he<03e0>may make an exception...
Shimmering blond hair framing that well-made face...<03e0>Lord David certainly cuts a striking figure.<04e0>You just can't keep from looking at him...<03e0>I mean, looking up to him...
Welcome back, cutie!<04e0>Some girl's been coming around here lately,<03e0>all mysterious-like. She's quite a stunner, too...<03e0>Can't compare to me, though!
Say, you know <1be0ffbe34ff>Celapaleis<1ce0>, right?<03e0>They're Athlum's sovereign state. They're to<03e0>the northwest, on the tip of the continent.
I head over to Celapaleis from time to time to<03e0>check out their new accessories.<04e0>You should definitely visit, hon. You'd love it.
Oh, hi, hon. Now, I don't want to get you<03e0>all flustered, but those soldiers over there<03e0>are here looking for you...<04e0>You haven't been doing something naughty<03e0>here in Athlum, have you? Aren't you a little<03e0>scamp! You remind me of myself...
What's that face for?<03e0>Knotting your brows like that brings bad luck,<03e0>you know.
Hi, hon. Those guards are looking for you<03e0>again. Something about having a message<03e0>from Lord David...<04e0>Now, my pub serves many of the Athlumian<03e0>Guard, but I'm not fond of soldiers in my<03e0>place on business, so go talk to them, m'kay?
I can't believe it...a message from the<03e0>beautiful Marquis<07f0>for you? Just what is the<03e0>relationship between you two anyway!?<04e0>Ooh! I'm so jealous I could throw a fit!
You're going, aren't you? To Wyrmskeep...to<03e0>Nagapur.<04e0>Duke Hermeien is a cold and ruthless man.<03e0>Watch yourself around him, Rush.<04e0>And, if you run into that Conqueror bastard...<03e0>Get Lady Emma's revenge!
Ah, you're late! I've been waiting for you for<03e0>ages... Lord David's been looking for you, too.<04e0>Seems like Duke Ghor needs him for something...<03e0>Anyhow, you'd better head to the castle.
Ah, I guess now it's Chairman Ghor, huh. He's<03e0>supposed to be quite the manly and valiant<03e0>leader.<04e0>If nothing else, he seems like a good man to<03e0>lead the continent after all that's happened.
Independence... Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?<03e0>If only dear Papa had gotten a chance to hear it...
So, you're going to fight the Conqueror...<03e0>You'd better come back safe, alright, buster?<03e0>If you don't...you'll hear from me!
Oh man, the other night, the bartender got really<03e0>wasted and wandered all the way up to the<03e0>Robelia ruins.<04e0>And then, a guy who looked just like the<03e0>bartender popped out of nowhere and attacked!<03e0>...At least, that's what he says.<04e0>I dunno, he could've just passed out and<03e0>dreamt the whole thing.
East of town is a huge stretch of fields,<03e0>the Yamarn Plain.<04e0>The place has been a battlefield for years and<03e0>years. People've fought everyone from monster<03e0>hordes to the Ghor army.<04e0>Seriously, if an average Joe like me were to<03e0>even step into that place, I'd be coming back<03e0>in a pine box!
Celapaleis? Ah, that's the big city a ways to<03e0>the north. It's Athlum's sovereign capital.<04e0>Thanks to them, our army can't even jump<03e0>without having to ask that Qubine kid how high.
You been to the Town Square yet?<04e0>It's a shocker, isn't it? The Valeria Heart's<03e0>gone, like it was never there in the first place!<04e0>That Remnant was more than just the symbol of<03e0>the town. The whole square is a place of<03e0>countless memories for every Athlumian...<04e0>Dammit. Bartender, mix me up something<03e0>strong, would you?
That new chairman of the Congress, Ghor, he's the<03e0>one that lives in that run-down fortress, eh?<04e0>When he came into office, I figured he was all brawn<03e0>and no brains, but he's done quite the job of getting<03e0>things under control.<04e0>And now, he's even sending folks to find us all new<03e0>Remnants? That's a good sort if I've ever seen one!
Apparently it was the Duke of Ghor who suggested to<03e0>Qubine that Athlum was ready for independence.<04e0>Even folks like us who used to be enemies, he sees 'em<03e0>at their true worth... That is a real man there, that Ghor.
We'll definitely beat the Conqueror. I believe it so<03e0>strongly that I'm gonna sit right here and have another<03e0>pint.
"In a time rocked by peril, even the earth itself<03e0>trembled from its ferocity, until one day all evil<03e0>was stilled by a giant blade, thrust by the gods..."<04e0>That's the legend of the Valeria Heart. When I<03e0>was young, my father would tell me the story<03e0>over and over.<04e0>But he usually followed it up with something like<03e0>"you'd better be good, or the Valeria Heart's<03e0>gonna get you."
That story about the Valeria Heart was just a<03e0>bunch of bull!<04e0>The Conqueror... He did so many bad things<07f0>he<03e0>even killed Lady Emma<07f0>where's the punishment<03e0>for that, huh?<04e0>And I believed in the Valeria Heart! I really did,<03e0>after all this time... Dammit!
Athlum's independence...? Don't get me wrong, it's not<03e0>like I'm trying to rain on everybody's parade, but... I<03e0>dunno. I just can't seem to get into it right now.
This time...this time the Conqueror is going to pay for<03e0>what he's done! And we can finally find out the truth<03e0>about the Valeria Heart!
Seems like they've started rebuilding the Numor Mines.<03e0>They've still gotta clean out the monsters what live<03e0>there, so it'll be a bit before the grand re-opening.<04e0>It'll be pretty rough not to be able to freely harvest<03e0>there anymore... I heard they've finally got the lift<03e0>working to the lowest level, though.<04e0>If ever there was a time to hit the mines, this is it.
Me?<03e0>I'm the monster slayer.<04e0>Whaddya need?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Tell me about monsters.<09e008e0010000000000>Nothing! Happy hunting.
Alright, mate.<03e0>You've got the time to sit for a spell?<04e0>Can't rush monsters, yanno!<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm not busy.<09e008e0010000000000>Oh, okay. Later, then.
Ahh, that's too bad.<03e0>Well, come back when you have time.
Alright then!<03e0>Here we go.
Well, when you meet with a monster, take a good long<03e0>look at them. If you really take a minute, you can tell<03e0>if they're ready to rumble or not.
Keep your distance, though; if you can check it out<03e0>without it seeing you, that's best.<03e0>That's a hunter trick, eh?
Next is the battle! Now, when you pick a fight with<03e0>a monster, you gotta be careful<07f0>you could end up<03e0>fighting him and his buddies, to boot.
If you're hunting for sport, that's a horse of a different<03e0>color. If you want rewards, you'll want to take on as<03e0>many monsters at once as you can.<04e0>But don't play around, doing any funny stuff when they<03e0>get close. Even if they look calm, you never know<03e0>what a beast's gonna do, eh?
Remember, practice makes perfect. Have some<03e0>confidence in yourself and you'll do fine.
Me?<03e0>I'm the monster sla<07f0>eh?<03e0>Ah, you again.<04e0>I guess you wanna know about monsters, eh?<03e0>It's a long talk, though, you have time this time?<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm all yours.<09e008e0010000000000>Ahh, sorry, gotta run.
Well...that's enough for now, hmm? Any more and you'll<03e0>be putting me out of a job! The rest you'll just have to<03e0>figure out for yourself. Happy hunting!
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...<04e0>You there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah...why?<09e008e0010000000000>You're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
*snort* Playing dumb won't get you anywhere<07f0>if you're<03e0>playing at all.<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...<04e0>You're Rush Sykes, right?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup, I'm Rush!<09e008e0010000000000>Nope, I'm, uh, someone else.
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.<04e0>He says he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>information-gathering, and that you should come to<03e0>the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> for details.<04e0>Got it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,<03e0>though<07f0>you're not in trouble...not with us at least.<03e0>Lord David's put out a summons for you.<04e0>Apparently he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>your information-gathering, so he'd like you to come<03e0>to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> so he can share it with you.<04e0>Don't make him wait too long, okay, kid? Or else you<03e0>might end up in trouble with us after all... Just joking!
Ohh! That valiant form...<04e0>You must be Rush Sykes, are you not?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The one and only!<09e008e0010000000000>Depends on who's asking.
Well met!<03e0>David, Marquis of Athlum requests that you come<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Athlum Castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!<03e0>I bring a message from Lord David. He requests that<03e0>you come to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Oh, you.<04e0>The only reason I even agreed to travel with<03e0>you is for the money. If you want to get all chatty,<03e0>find someone else. Quit wasting my time.
You again?<03e0>What part of "don't talk to me" don't you understand?<04e0>I know you just think I'm some money-grubbing<03e0>bitch, and to be frank, I couldn't care less. The only<03e0>things I care about are shiny and gold.<04e0>Why?<03e0>I don't think that's any of your business. If you really<03e0>want to know...it'll cost you.
Do I need a sign saying "Get freaking lost"?<03e0>Look, I don't want to talk. I want to make money.<03e0>If you aren't helping me with the latter, piss off.
How long are you planning on sitting around like this?<03e0>I haven't got the time to be lolling around drooling on<03e0>myself like you.<04e0>There's gotta be some job we can take... Patrol duty,<03e0>monster hunting, even a blorging fetch quest... Throw me<03e0>a bone here!<04e0>Urgh, I'm sure the Ladies're scrambling for cash even<03e0>as we speak... They understand the concept of needing<03e0>a place to live and food to eat...<04e0>I can't understand you people at all.
Seriously, you're still sitting around here slacking off?<03e0>I don't care if you're lazy, time is money, and I can't<03e0>waste either. Can we get back to work, please?
Am I tired?<03e0>From this shit? Don't make me laugh.<04e0>Try living hand-to-mouth, always on the run, never able<03e0>to stop even a minute without having to check over your<03e0>shoulder for<07f004e0>...Never mind.<03e0>Could you<07f0>could you not mention I said anything like<03e0>this? Damn, I guess I really am tired...<04e0>Hey, kid...<03e0>Your name's "Sykes," right? So your parents're the<03e0>same as those famous researchers, yeah?<04e0>They ever tell you anything about some shady secret<03e0>projects going on at the Academy?<04e0>...<04e0>Bah, one look at your face and I can tell you don't know<03e0>a thing. Whatever, don't waste your two brain cells<03e0>worrying about it.<04e0>I've got a headache...<03e0>Let me alone for a bit.
Look.<03e0>Please, leave me alone for a bit.
Rush...you again.<04e0>Alright, you wanna talk? Let's chat.<03e0>But if I'm gonna talk, you'd damned well better listen.<04e0>Let me tell you about the Ladies of Bloody Alice...<03e0>We started out attached to the Academy's Third<03e0>Committee.<04e0>As you probably know, they do the research too dirty<03e0>for the other scientists... We handled a lot of their<03e0>testing for them.<04e0>Heh, "testing" sounds so neat and clean compared to<03e0>some of the shit we did... Of course, we didn't object<03e0>at the time. We "Ladies" were far from ladylike.<04e0>More like some of the roughest bitches you'd ever<03e0>meet. Some of us even thought we were lucky to get<03e0>such a sweet gig. But...eventually, our luck ran out.<04e0>One day we found ourselves as the subjects in their<03e0>latest tests<07f0>tests to fuse a person with a Remnant...<04e0>So now I gotta eat like some bottomless pit, 'cause<03e0>if I don't have several times the normal nutritional<03e0>requirements for a mitra, I'll die.<04e0>Pathetic, huh.<04e0>...<04e0>The hell're you looking like that for? If I wanted your<03e0>pity I'd have made up some sob story about losing<03e0>my goldfish or some shit.<04e0>Just...<03e0>I just felt like telling you is all.<04e0>What's done is done. No use wallowing in it.<03e0>Better to live life while you can.
Hey, kid.<04e0>Where're we off to next?<03e0>Make sure it pays well, eh?
Nothing much has been going on lately...
You know Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis? Seems his<03e0>wife's disappeared. ...'Course, those two are famous<03e0>for not getting along, so it's nothing new.
...That's the story, anyway.
What a shameful excuse for a wife!<03e0>You know, I'D know how to properly take care<03e0>of a man...
I don't want to believe it, but it seems like there's<03e0>some crazy woman plotting to assassinate<03e0>Duke Qubine...
...That's the story, anyway.
Poor Lord Qubine...he is too adorable to have to<03e0>deal with such ridiculous things!
So, the desert princess has been sneaking away<03e0>pretty regularly to meet some guy she's been<03e0>mooning over. But sounds kinda dangerous to me...
...That's the story, anyway.
I know, right? Anyone could take advantage of<03e0>a sheltered little princess like that... I hope she<03e0>doesn't get mixed up in anything bad!
Hey!<03e0>So, the desert princess has eloped with her man!
...That's the story, anyway.
Aughhh... That Lord Paris is absolutely fine. I was<03e0>certain he was on our team... *sigh*
Seems relations between Balterossa and Royotia have<03e0>taken a nosedive. All the families of the soldiers are<03e0>getting worried since the armies are being mobilized...
...That's the story, anyway.
Augh, what a crisis! War isn't going to fix anything.<03e0>And if Paris's face were to be scarred or something<07f003e0>Ooh, I'm getting verklempt just thinking about it!
I know, right?
So there's supposed to be something the Imperator<03e0>sealed out in the great swamp... Problem is, the seal's<03e0>broken. Could be the entrance to some other world...
...That's the story, anyway.
Everyone has things in their past they'd like to<03e0>seal away. I can't even count how many things<03e0>I'd like to forget...
There's a Forest Maiden who's so attuned to the Knight<03e0>she's bound to, she can like, see through his eyes or<03e0>hear things he's heard, or something like that.
...That's the story, anyway.
I've got the soul of a pure, innocent young maid too,<03e0>you know. Born again, anyway.
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina<03e0>are mobilizing... Seems something's happened to<03e0>the Last Leaf in Crookfen.
...That's the story, anyway.
I wonder what's going on.<03e0>I know, let's go check it out!
Wh-what about the pub?
It's almost time for Kosmosfest, huh. But apparently<03e0>the Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to Nagapur yet.<03e0>Maybe she got mixed up in something...
...That's the story, anyway.
Well! You simply cannot have a Kosmosfest without<03e0>a Cosmos Maiden! Noble spirit I am, I volunteer myself<03e0>to take her place! ...It'll cost them, though.
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started<03e0>the Kosmosfest alright. Usually the ceremony's a bunch<03e0>of hooey, but this time it was interrupted by monsters.
...That's the story, anyway.
I've heard the Kosmosfest is just so romantic...like<03e0>something out of an old story.<03e0>...Ahhh, I want to gooo!
Some old-fashioned chick is looking to hire bodyguards,<03e0>I hear. She's supposed to be hanging out at the pub<03e0>near the canal.
...That's the story, anyway.
What's she doing that needs that much protection?<03e0>I mean, you don't see me surrounding myself with<03e0>brawny beefcakes... Not for money, anyway.
You're not into antiques, are you? Apparently a lot of the<03e0>treasures of the Old Kingdoms are turning up on the black<03e0>market.
...That's the story, anyway.
Someone's stealing treasures? You can't possibly mean<03e0>that someone could be coming for my precious!<03e0>I'll never allow it to be on the black market!
I'm sure yours will be exempt.
Some guy is looking for these three stones that're<03e0>really important to the desert. Historically significant,<03e0>or something.
...That's the story, anyway.
Rocks, pfft. I'm looking for three wonderful men!<03e0>That's something that would be really important to<03e0>the entire world...or at least the me-part of it.
Some guy into ancient magick is looking for people<03e0>to help out with research. Seems he's on the verge<03e0>of unlocking some huge mysteries.
...That's the story, anyway.
Ancient magick, hm? This guy must be a real brainiac.<03e0>Maybe I'll volunteer...there's something to be said for a<03e0>man who knows what he's doing.
So some folks are crying it's the end of the world<03e0>over some freaky monster. Apparently it was sealed<03e0>by the Imperator, and now it's back...
...That's the story, anyway.
All the more reason to spread love while we can, hm?
Some amnesiac is wandering around the cities in<03e0>the desert, looking for something that could regain<03e0>his memory.
...That's the story, anyway.
How mysterious! I wonder what sorts of exciting<03e0>exploits he could have forgotten. Interest piqued~
Recently people've been seeing this infamous bandit<03e0>around Athlum. Apparently he's waiting around for<03e0>someone but no one's brave enough to ask who.
...That's the story, anyway.
Eek! No question, he's waiting for me! When I said<03e0>I wanted a big strong man to take me away, I didn't<03e0>mean like this...
For you...?<03e0>I guess stranger things have happened.
There's a statue in the Robelia Ruins that's supposed<03e0>to let you meet anyone in the world, no matter how<03e0>far. Some kid looking for his sister wants it...
...That's the story, anyway.
How amazing! It's like something out of a storybook.<03e0>Ahh, what I could do with a statue like that...
(Who does he want to...<03e0>Nah, I don't even want to know.)
Some strange<07f0>thing has been terrorizing Celapaleis.<03e0>It's totally freaking out the people there.
...That's the story, anyway.
Oh, I'm sure the poor thing is just lonely. It just needs<03e0>a friend, and maybe a big hug.
There's a murderer on the loose in the capital!
...That's the story, anyway.
That is simply terrible! I certainly hope they find the<03e0>killer and bring him to justice soon! Ooh, and all<03e0>my favorite boutiques are there...
Augh, don't scrape your nails on the dishes!
There's some massive yama who needs help looking<03e0>for stuff... But he's kinda, uh, weird, so people've<03e0>been trying to keep out of his way.
...That's the story, anyway.
I'm looking for something, too... The perfect partner.<03e0>Experience is preferred, but trainees are welcome...
Some white qsiti's been looking for a magickal book.<03e0>People seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's<03e0>been able to place him.
...That's the story, anyway.
A white qsiti? That's pretty rare. If I got him to work<03e0>here, I bet we'd get loads more customers.
It's a bar, not a sideshow...
There's this set of twins that've turned up as<03e0>mercenaries lately...good ones, too. One is supposed to<03e0>be a real cool customer<07f0>both in looks, and in attitude.
...That's the story, anyway.
Hmph. If you ask me, better to be hot than cool.
Some guy out in the Great Sand Sea's been looking<03e0>for challengers. But he's not interested in Joe<03e0>Schmoes off the street.
...That's the story, anyway.
Mmm, dangerous men are so intriguing! I bet we could<03e0>go head-to-head in a few different "challenges"...
Some old warrior's been crossing the Great Sand<03e0>Sea, looking for a special sword.
...That's the story, anyway.
Spend that much time in the desert and you'll end up<03e0>with skin like old leather! Ugh, there's no way I'd do<03e0>that, not for all the moisturizer in the world!
The guards of Ghor have all sworn to follow their<03e0>ruler for as long as they live.
...That's the story, anyway.
Everyone says the Duke of Ghor is a brave and<03e0>honorable man. Maybe I should drop everything and<03e0>follow him for as long as I live, too...
What about staying faithful to this pub!?
There's not a family in the world as dedicated as<03e0>the Honeywells. If you've got them at your back,<03e0>you can do anything.
...That's the story, anyway.
I certainly believe that! I completely respect Lady<03e0>Emma. With her to look up to, Athlum's girls should be<03e0>stronger and more beautiful than anywhere else.
Yeah! I look up to her too.
So, this gossip is pretty juicy... Apparently General<03e0>Torgal is supposed to have figures from his past<03e0>popping up in Royotia...
...That's the story, anyway.
That poor thing. Now, this is just between us girls,<03e0>but I completely feel the general's pain of having<03e0>an estranged little brother...
Your brother came in here yesterday!
It's about time for the Tournament of Heroes to<03e0>start up again. It's pretty well-known among the types<03e0>with fighting spirit.
...That's the story, anyway.
There's something about wild, feral men locked in<03e0>battle, struggling for domination, muscles straining and<03e0>gleaming with sweat... Ooh, I should get my tickets!
Apparently there's some mystic academy that's<03e0>been spitting out skilled magi for years.
...That's the story, anyway.
Brains are an important part of a good man! That's<03e0>why they're so hard to find...
Athlum's been going through some tough times, and<03e0>people are worried about the new matriarch of the<03e0>Honeywell clan because she's so young.
...That's the story, anyway.
She'll be just fine. She's like a carbon copy of the<03e0>Lady Emma at that age.
Yeah! I don't think we'll have to worry either!
Recently there's been gossip about Lord David's love<03e0>interests...or lack thereof. He's never been connected<03e0>with anybody.
...That's the story, anyway.
Of course! Lord David is concentrating on the<03e0>important things of running a country. ...Plus, he's<03e0>saving himself for me. Sorry, ladies!
The old head of the Academy's been seen in pubs<03e0>across the continent lately. I guess it makes sense<03e0>she'd want to drown her sorrows after what happened.
...That's the story, anyway.
Drinking to forget... Does she really believe this<03e0>will make things better?
Dr. Sykes has been seen going in and out of the<03e0>castle a lot lately. Guess there's been a breakthrough?
...That's the story, anyway.
Dr. John Sykes... He's definitely got the brains, but<03e0>somehow he's got this rugged charm that's<03e0>irresistible... Eh, Marina Sykes? Who's that?
Some unidentified flying object's been spotted<03e0>swooping around Wyrmskeep. It's totally been<03e0>freaking everyone out...
...That's the story, anyway.
Augh! Does that mean that last time I went to<03e0>Nagapur to pick up a few things, that<07f0>thing<03e0>could've been slavering over me!?
You do always say you want to pick up more<03e0>attention...
Some hot-blooded female warrior is trying to hunt<03e0>down that group causing trouble in Crookfen. But<03e0>it's against her boss's wishes...
...That's the story, anyway.
I was quite the hot-blooded warrior in my youth, too.<03e0>Oh, the adventures I had... I could tell you the story,<03e0>but it'd be morning before I was even halfway through.
H-how long is this story supposed to be!?
Some monster army's appeared in the Great Sand<03e0>Sea. They're so powerful that everyone in Balterossa<03e0>is totally in despair...
...That's the story, anyway.
Only those who've known despair know the true<03e0>meaning of hope... So, everyone should have the<03e0>chance to taste despair at least once!
Yeah, well, this could be their first and last chance!
According to ancient historians, there's something<03e0>dangerous enough to destroy entire cities sealed<03e0>within the volcano...
...That's the story, anyway.
Pish tosh. My love for Lord David is enough to rock<03e0>the whole city of Athlum!
Hey, I'm trying to be serious here!
No one knows what's going on inside the volcano,<03e0>and no one knows how to find out... But, the Marquis<03e0>of Royotia might have some ideas...
...That's the story, anyway.
He's the one with the magnificent mustache, right?<03e0>Any man that takes such incredible care of his<03e0>facial hair has got to know a secret or two.
Huh, never figured you for a bear chaser.
You know there's a town without anyone running<03e0>it? The old ruler's sons are fighting over the seat<03e0>of power.
...That's the story, anyway.
Don't talk to me about bloodthirsty succession<03e0>struggles! I fought long and hard to get this pub...
Are...are you serious!?
When you're out in the desert, you can hear this sad,<03e0>lonely voice crying from beneath the Great Sand Sea.
...That's the story, anyway.
You poor dear... Everyone's experienced loneliness.<03e0>You're not the only one who's ever felt like crying...
N-no, that's not what I meant...
A long time ago, there used to be a famed hero<03e0>that lived in the Great Sand Sea.
...That's the story, anyway.
Anyone that famous had to have been a simply<03e0>amazing man... If only I were born a few hundred<03e0>years earlier! *sigh*
So I was walking through the Town Square and heard<03e0>this guy all "you gotta believe me! If you look at the<03e0>pillars in the Great Sand Sea, then...g-g-gra<07f0>!"
...That's the story, anyway.
"G-g-granny," he says!? How rude! I'm not even<03e0>close to hitting my prime, that cheeky little<07f0>ooh!
Some crackpot old scientist has been wandering<03e0>around Melphina. If you go over there, you probably<03e0>should stay away, he's giving people strange looks.
...That's the story, anyway.
Hmm? What sort of looks, I wonder? If it's the look<03e0>of a wounded heart, then he should come here and<03e0>recover in our healing, friendly atmosphere!
Sure<07f0>so long as he pays for his food and drink<03e0>afterwards!
The cafe out in Baaluk's supposedly infested with<03e0>bugs...they followed the owner all the way from the<03e0>desert.
...That's the story, anyway.
Ew, ew, ew! Ugh, I hate bugs!
I'm pretty sure they aren't too fond of you, either...
Nagapur's been increasingly unsafe. Recently a bunch<03e0>of kids have gone missing...
...That's the story, anyway.
Good gracious! Could it be kidnapping? I had better<03e0>be careful as well.
Adventurers have gotten into trading the different<03e0>loot they find on their trips, apparently. Royotia's<03e0>the main hub for the fad.
...That's the story, anyway.
How sad. My greatest treasures are the secret<03e0>feelings bottled within my heaving bosom. But I<03e0>wouldn't trade them for anything in the world!
...Right.
Royotian merchants are getting frustrated with<03e0>Balterossa...they control all of their trade routes.
...That's the story, anyway.
Yes, Royotian jewels are incredibly expensive. I'd<03e0>really love to pick some up, but I just don't have the<03e0>money. Maybe if I gave my staff a pay cut...
Wh-what!? No way!
Some yama mercenary's out looking for a partner.<03e0>Could be a good way to make a few G.
...That's the story, anyway.
Ooh, that must be him over there, no? What a strong,<03e0>strapping man... Mm, if I were you, hon, I'd definitely<03e0>partner up with him.
Some guy with a hot-and-cold personality's shown up<03e0>in Celapaleis. He'll seem really nice and then<03e0>start cursing people out at the drop of a hat.
...That's the story, anyway.
Mmm, for some reason I always feel drawn to<03e0>bipolar men like that. I guess they just spark my<03e0>maternal instincts...
"Maternal"...?
There's some qsiti going to crowded places and<03e0>standing in everyone's way, and then picking fights<03e0>with people who run into him. What an annoyance...
...That's the story, anyway.
Oh! I've run into that guy before...literally. If he ever<03e0>comes in here, the only thing I'm serving him is a<03e0>knuckle sandwich!
So, apparently there's some mysterious lady looking<03e0>for someone to help her with something. She seemed<03e0>to have something important to ask.
...That's the story, anyway.
I also have something to ask...
What?
I told you about the mysterious woman from before,<03e0>right? Seems she's still waiting for something really<03e0>important. I hear she looks super worried...
...That's the story, anyway.
I'm waiting for something really important, too...<03e0>Or someone...
You're just waiting for anyone at all.
You've probably seen them if you've been hanging<03e0>around Crookfen, but Bloody Alice has been gathering.<03e0>Looks like something big's going on...
...That's the story, anyway.
I wanted to join them once...Bloody Alice. Of course,<03e0>back then I was a bit of a rebel, going against the<03e0>grain and all that.
I wouldn't say you're quite going with the grain now...
Seems the Jhana have been popping up in the Great<03e0>Sand Sea. You wouldn't think they'd have forgotten<03e0>being blasted by the Gae Bolg already...
...That's the story, anyway.
Well... Once you quit trying, your life is over. How's<03e0>it different for beastmen? If you've got a goal, keep<03e0>trying until you reach it!
That's great, but not when the goal is destroying<03e0>the city!
Recently the Silver Falcons took out a pack of Jhana.
...That's the story, anyway.
You know, I'm a member of the official Silver Falcons<03e0>fan club! Their sovani leader is so stoic and manly...
The Silver Falcons have been going after the<03e0>leftovers of the Conqueror's army. Who knows<03e0>what those guys could be up to...
...That's the story, anyway.
Good luck, Falcons! Perhaps to help out, I'll go take<03e0>a refreshing drink to that delicious commander.
B-but who's gonna run the pub?
Some gloomy-looking guy's been hanging around the<03e0>pub in Elysion recently, and bumming everyone out.
...That's the story, anyway.
For some reason, I just find myself drawn to dark<03e0>and brooding men... I just want to uncover all their<03e0>mysteries, lay them bare before me...
You kinda find yourself drawn to everyone...

Many young women have disappeared around the <1be0ffbe34ff>Gaslin<03e0>Caves<1ce0>. At the same time, a seedy group has been seen<03e0>around the <1be0ffbe34ff>Robelia Ruins<1ce0>.<04e0>Which will you investigate first?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The Gaslin Caves<09e008e0010000000000>The Robelia Ruins

The ruins, then?<03e0>Go. Pagus will accompany you.
Then, you're decided?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah, let's check it out!<09e008e0010000000000>Mmm...maybe I'd better switch...
The <1be0ffbe34ff>Gaslin Caves<1ce0> and <1be0ffbe34ff>Robelia Ruins<1ce0>... Perhaps a clue<03e0>to finding Miss Irina can be found there.
I appreciate your assistance at the Gaslin Caves.<04e0>...I see, Miss Irina was not there.<04e0>Perhaps there is a clue to be found with the unsavory<03e0>types seen gathering at the <1be0ffbe34ff>Robelia Castle ruins<1ce0>.<04e0>Pagus, I leave the rest to you.

Rush, I want you to go to <1be0ffbe34ff>Dillmoor<1ce0> along with my<03e0>Generals.<04e0>Be careful.
Ah, yes.<03e0>Rush, there was something I wanted to give you.<03e0>Emma, if you would?
The battles from now on will only become fiercer.<03e0>I hope that this jacket will make it a little easier<03e0>for you.
Thanks, Dave.
Celapaleis has sighted men matching the description<03e0>of the ones we encountered in Dillmoor. They request<03e0>we look into it at once.<04e0>Once you've completed your preparations, let us head<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Blackdale<1ce0>.
A girl matching Irina's description was seen in<03e0>the clutches of the flying Remnant.<04e0>So, this is the true face of the men slighting Athlum...<03e0>I will find them and make them regret this!
To reach the holy city of <1be0ffbe34ff>Elysion<1ce0>, we must cross the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Ivory Peaks<1ce0>, a mountain range to the southeast of here.<04e0>It won't be an easy journey, so make sure you're<03e0>ready, Rush.
Rush, if you're ever in need of more soldiers, speak<03e0>with the security guard in the <1be0ffbe34ff>Town Square<1ce007f0>he's an<03e01be0ffbe34ff>army recruitment officer<1ce0>.<04e0>I'll see to it that plenty of soldiers will be available to<03e0>you at any time. Some of them may be...strange, to say<03e0>the least, but they're all good men.
The Sykes have left the main campus of the Academy<03e0>and should be within the <1be0ffbe34ff>Temple of Elysion<1ce0>.<04e0>Let's head to the temple, Rush.
I suppose that even Emma has things she<03e0>cannot tell me about.<04e0>...Go on, Rush. I'll take care of your father.
The dragon castle of <1be0ffbe34ff>Nagapur<1ce0> is to the northeast<03e0>of Elysion, past the <1be0ffbe34ff>Heroic Ramparts<1ce0>.<04e0>Hurry and get ready. I'd like to head to Nagapur<03e0>as soon as possible.
The Conqueror's supremacy on the battlefield has been<03e0>more than proven. At this rate, it is only a matter of<03e0>time before Celapaleis falls.<04e0>We cannot allow that to happen! All forces<07f0>to the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Nest of Eagles<1ce0>!
Our true foe is the Duke of Nagapur<07f0>Wilfred<03e0>Hermeien. No more will we be puppets in his<03e0>petty farce.<04e0>To <1be0ffbe34ff>Nagapur<1ce0>...and to vengeance!
Hey, Rush. Before you leave town, make sure<03e0>your equipment is all set, alright?
Let's do it, Rush!
Rush! Those thugs've probably got a Remnant.<03e0>Don't think it's gonna be a cakewalk, alright?
Rush, if you've got some extra <1be0ffbe34ff>components<1ce0>, you<03e0>should take 'em down to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Customization Shop<1ce0>.<03e0>They can fix your equipment up good!
Ugh, I can't stand those jerks in Celapaleis. They're<03e0>always like "Athlum, do this! Athlum, do that!" It really<03e0>burns me up!<04e0>Like, this time. Sure, it's good to know bad stuff's going<03e0>on, but you don't gotta gloat when you tell it! Makes me<03e0>just wanna<07f0>argh!
Going to Elysion for the Congress, huh... I can't help<03e0>but feel nervous. You understand, I bet!<04e0>Not like either of us would be taking part, though!
My gramps used to tell me stories about the Temple<03e0>of Elysion... Like, how there was a place in there where<03e0>they used to put dead folks...<04e0>You...you don't think we'd have to go to that part, do<03e0>you? No way, right?
Oi, Rush. Don't slow Lady Emma down too much, got it?<03e0>If you make her angry, it won't be the monsters you'll<03e0>have to worry about! Gahahaha!<04e0>Don't worry about your pop, alright? I'll take good care<03e0>of him, no matter what!
If Athlum could get its independence, then...oh man.<03e0>It'd be like a dream or something... I sure hope these<03e0>talks with Duke Hermeien go well!
What kind of monsters are the Conqueror's army made<03e0>of!? Sneaking around behind our backs<07f0>what,<03e0>they've never heard of sportsmanship?<04e0>C'mon, Rush, we gotta hurry to the Nest of Eagles<03e0>and show those cowards what real men are made of!
When I first became one of the Four Generals,<03e0>Lady Emma would bust my hump every single<03e0>day.<04e0>It took me a while, but I realized that I really<03e0>appreciated those words...they're what made me<03e0>into the man I am today.<04e0>The Conqueror...that bastard Hermeien...<03e0>I'll never forgive them for what they did. Never!
The Gaslin Caves are a stretch of caverns<03e0>created by massive earthquakes long before<03e0>Athlum was founded.<04e0>Robelia Castle was built 300 years ago by Baron<03e0>Vonn d'Herouet, who, incidentally, was later<03e0>betrayed by one of his vassals and killed.<04e0>By now, both locations have come to be<03e0>inhabited by monsters and criminals...
I look forward to working with you, Rush.
Rush, we should not waste any time. Let us rescue<03e0>Miss Irina as soon as possible!
A mage wearing white and a flying Remnant have been<03e0>confirmed among the troops sighted invading Blackdale.<04e0>It's no question that they must be the same men we<03e0>encountered at Dillmoor...<04e0>We must be careful not to underestimate them. Keep<03e0>your head about you, Rush.
As I'm sure you already know, the Academy is a<03e0>worldwide organization which officially oversees all<03e0>Remnant-related research.<04e0>If that Wagram character truly is connected to the<03e0>Academy, he has very influential backing. It will be no<03e0>simple matter to go after him.
As you probably know, Elysion is a city at the center<03e0>of the continent.<04e0>Along the way, I'm sure we'll face unknown monsters<03e0>and new groups of bandits...<04e0>Well, we'll know once we see them!
Within the Temple of Elysion is a location known as<03e0>the Catacombs.<04e0>Once it was a burial place, but nowadays it is more<03e0>infamous as the birthplace of many<07f0>strange monsters.<04e0>Strange, as in...how can I put this... It's<07f0>difficult<03e0>to explain. Allow me to just say that I am not very<03e0>fond of the Catacombs.
Emma may be going with you, but you should still be<03e0>very careful. Danger lurks around every corner.
The Duke of Nagapur, Wilfred Hermeien, is a youthful<03e0>and extremely capable ruler. However, he is rumored to<03e0>be as cruel as he is clever...<04e0>If there is any hope for these negotiations to succeed,<03e0>we will have to be at least fractionally as shrewd as he is.
The Celapaleis forces are being heavily battered by the<03e0>Conqueror's army.<04e0>At this rate it's only a matter of time before they invade<03e0>the city. Rush, we must head to the Nest of Eagles<03e0>with all haste!
Miss Emmy is the spitting image of her mother when<03e0>she was young. It takes me back to when I first met<03e0>Lady Emma...<04e0>We will not allow her sacrifice to have been in vain!<04e0>Duke Hermeien's machinations stop here!
Remember, you're before Lord David now.<03e0>Watch your tongue.
Hmph, you're surprisingly competent.<04e0>Still, the next battle stands to be difficult.<03e0>Make certain you're amply prepared.
Going so far as to require Lord David to come along as<03e0>part of their "request"... Celapaleis really loves rubbing<03e0>our faces in it.<04e0>Still, this could be a good chance to learn what that<03e0>magus in white is all about. We won't be letting him off<03e0>easily this time.
Athlum is required to provide for Celapaleis's defense<03e0>at all times.<04e0>Their assumption that we'll always protect them is<03e0>something that is far from popular within Athlum.<03e0>Yet it is our duty as a territory.<04e0>I know it, and understand it, but I certainly don't like<03e0>it.
Elysion is considered the capital of the continent.<04e0>A mass of rock floats above the city, called the<03e0>Sacred Lands. It's quite an impressive sight.<04e0>Still, before all that, there's a long road ahead.<03e0>Don't slack on your preparations.
There are many temples in Elysion's Genaade<03e0>District. The Temple of Elysion in particular has<03e0>a long and venerable history.<04e0>Considering how secretive the group we're dealing<03e0>with is, I doubt it will be a simple thing for us to<03e0>enter the Temple...<04e0>Hmph, whatever. If our words aren't convincing<03e0>enough, then our blades will have to be.
I have an idea of where Marina might have run<03e0>to. We made each other a promise, once...<04e0>I'll be waiting in Elysion's Hendler section. Find<03e0>me there when you're ready.
Lord David seems to be getting stronger by the<03e0>day.<04e0>I had no idea he'd thought so deeply on<03e0>Athlum's independence.<04e0>He's come quite a long way from the little boy<03e0>who clung to my skirts after his mother passed.
Hmph. To be certain, at first I only thought you<03e0>a silly, sheltered hayseed, but you've really<03e0>grown a lot. I admit I'm a bit impressed.<04e0>That said, don't get too full of yourself, Rush.
So...<03e0>You are the son of the famed Doctors Sykes.<04e0>Lord David is completely committed to helping<03e0>you locate your sister Irina.
There is still much we do not know about Remnants.<03e0>The idea of one that can fly ought not be so shocking...
The men spotted in Dillmoor were accompanied<03e0>by an unidentified Remnant. Make haste in your<03e0>preparations so that we may set out.
While to the uninitiated it may appear as if we<03e0>were equals, in actuality Athlum is a territory<03e0>under Celapaleis's domain.<04e0>Still, to require Lord David to chase after a<03e0>simple group of unknowns is a situation I would<03e0>prefer be avoided in the future.
It is rumored that there are segments of the<03e0>Academy dedicated to more...illicit types of<03e0>Remnant testing.<04e0>Mayhap the mage in white is a part of that...<04e0>Still, we do not yet have the evidence to<03e0>confirm either way. We must learn more about<03e0>these men before anything else.
Many Lords will assemble for the Congress<03e0>session<07f0>all rulers of important and influential<03e0>countries. Please refrain from any rash actions.
As we have already been called out... Let's try<03e0>to avoid any actions that would further draw<03e0>Chairman Hermeien's attention, shall we?<04e0>Please try to exercise discretion in searching<03e0>the Temple.
Information she is unwilling to reveal to Lord<03e0>David? It isn't like Emma at all.<04e0>What could be so important to require only the<03e0>two of you to go<07f0>to an unknown location, at<03e0>that?<04e0>No doubt the battles you will face along the way<03e0>will be harsher than any you've encountered thus<03e0>far. Prepare yourself accordingly.
Any concession we attempt to get from Duke<03e0>Hermeien will likely be paid for by Athlum<03e0>being sent to fight the Conqueror.<04e0>I wish Lord David success in his negotiations,<03e0>yet...
While we were in Nagapur, the Conqueror's army<03e0>advanced all the way to Celapaleis...<03e0>Unbelievable.<04e0>To think, they dominated so easily... The<03e0>Conqueror seems rightly named.<04e0>If we take this lightly, we'll be destroyed along<03e0>with Celapaleis.<04e0>We'll need to keep our wits about us.
Emma traded her life to protect this country.<03e0>Now, we who are left must do all we can to<03e0>honor that.<04e0>Wilfred Hermeien is the one behind all this. We<03e0>will find him and we will destroy him. Emma's<03e0>sacrifice will not have been in vain.
Hermeien used the Conqueror's army to throw the whole<03e0>world into confusion...that's unforgivable.<04e0>I'll avenge my mother with these hands, I swear it!<03e0>Rush, let's get to Nagapur as soon as possible!
Fornstrand...?<03e0>There's supposed to be a Remnant there?
A report from the new chairman...Duke Ghor.<04e0>He's learnt there is a major Remnant located at<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Fornstrand<1ce0>, on the dark sea to the north of the<03e0>continent.<04e0>Let's not waste any time, Rush.
Let's hurry to <1be0ffbe34ff>Fornstrand<1ce0>, Rush.
Rush, there's been another urgent summons from<03e0>the Congress. We must head to <1be0ffbe34ff>Elysion<1ce0> at once.<04e0>...Please, don't worry about Irina.<04e0>She just wants to be by your side...even if that<03e0>journey takes her to the battlefield. She cares for<03e0>you, Rush.
It will take some time for Dr. Sykes to finish his<03e0>adjustments, so you're free to do what you like until<03e0>then. I'll send for you when there's any news.
Chairman Ghor has asked us all back to <1be0ffbe34ff>Elysion<1ce0> for<03e0>an emergency meeting of the Congress.<04e0>If Miss Irina wishes to come along as well, I have no<03e0>complaints. She's proven herself to be a skilled<03e0>researcher...much like her parents.
It seems that most of the Lords have been struck by<03e0>sudden and fierce illnesses.<04e0>I cannot believe this is just coincidence. We must look<03e0>into this further.
There is something terribly wrong with Duke Qubine.<04e0>Rush, let's head to <1be0ffbe34ff>Ghor<1ce0>. The chairman should be<03e0>informed of this as soon as possible.<04e0>The warrior town of Ghor is just west of the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Heroic Ramparts<1ce0>.
It seems we will have to do something about the<03e0>black lights around <1be0ffbe34ff>Koenigsdorf<1ce0> if we wish to enter.<04e0>Take care in your preparations, Rush. I've a feeling<03e0>these battles will be fiercer than we can even expect.
Irina seemed troubled by her powers, but I had no idea<03e0>it would come to this...<04e0>No, there's no time for that. Let's hurry to <1be0ffbe34ff>Darken<03e0>Forest<1ce0>. I made a promise...I cannot allow Irina to be<03e0>embroiled in our war any more than I already have.
The road to the imperial city is long and harsh.<04e0>Past the highlands stretching east of Elysion,<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Berechevaltelle<1ce0>, and then over <1be0ffbe34ff>Mt. Vackel<1ce0>...<03e0>There lies <1be0ffbe34ff>Undelwalt<1ce0>.<04e0>However, this is my first duty as representative<03e0>of the Congress Chairman, and I intend to do it<03e0>properly.<04e0>Rush, once you've finished your preparations<03e0>we will set out.
To reach <1be0ffbe34ff>Undelwalt<1ce0>, we must travel east<03e0>of Elysion to the great plains, <1be0ffbe34ff>Berechevaltelle<1ce0>;<03e0>and through there, climb <1be0ffbe34ff>Mt. Vackel<1ce0>.<04e0>Let me know when you're ready, Rush; we'll<03e0>leave once your preparations are complete.
...You know, the first time I laid eyes on you, I<03e0>was struck by how simple-minded and naïve<03e0>you seemed.<04e0>I knew you bore some special power. I thought<03e0>that if I kept you close, I could control you, and<03e0>have you use that power to Athlum's advantage.<04e0>But hearing your words, I realized I've been<03e0>blind. You've been the one in control all along<07f003e0>showing me the way.<04e0>In the end, it's I who's truly been simple-minded.<03e0>Thank you, Rush.<04e0>...Well. I suppose this really isn't the time for<03e0>such sentimental drivel.<04e0>All of Athlum's forces are to take up arms and<03e0>strike down the Conqueror! To the <1be0ffbe34ff>Holy Plain<1ce0>!
The Conqueror is in the <1be0ffbe34ff>Sacred Lands<1ce0>.<03e0>He cannot be allowed to roam free any longer.<03e0>He must be stopped!
Rush, what is it?<04e0>A sovani? Ah, Leucetius...<03e0>Now that I think of it, he did seem to have had<03e0>some urgent complaint he wanted to voice...<04e0>Either way, we just had a brief chat, then he left.<03e0>It's nothing you need to worry about.
Fornstrand, huh?<03e0>I don't really like that place...<04e0>The sky's always covered with dark clouds...<03e0>It kinda gives me the willies.
Heya, Rush! Good news about your pop, huh. He was<03e0>out of it for so long, I figured he was never gonna get<03e0>better...<04e0>Weeell, it all worked out, right? Sometimes it's good<03e0>when I'm wrong!
Geez Louise, that Duke Ghor is a friggin' slave driver!<03e0>Doesn't he ever remember that Athlum is far from just<03e0>about everywhere?<04e0>Still, this time, the little missy's coming along, huh.<03e0>Should be fun!
Geez-oh-Pete... Sure, the Lords are important and all,<03e0>but how come we've gotta find out what's wrong with<03e0>'em? I thought that's what doctors were for...
I never seen Duke Qubine lookin' like that before...<03e0>Usually he's kinda mouthy and annoying, but now<03e0>I'm a little worried about him...
Those black lights, huh... Wonder what we're gonna find?<04e0>Ehh, doesn't matter<07f0>whatever it is, I'm gonna knock it<03e0>into next week! Aw geez! I'm shaking...with excitement!
What...what!? Going all alone to that creepy forest,<03e0>what was that girl thinking!?<04e0>C'mon, Rush, what're you standing around here for?<03e0>We gotta go find Irina and bring her back!
Rush, didja hear!? We just got independence from<03e0>Celapaleis! Incredible, ain't it? I'm so psyched up,<03e0>I can't sit still!<04e0>Guess even that Qubine kid can be a nice guy<03e0>sometimes!
This might sound kinda sappy, but I'm real glad I've had<03e0>the chance to fight alongside you and the young master.<04e0>But seriously, Rush, if you think we're gonna let you<03e0>face the Conqueror all alone, you're dead wrong.<04e0>Whether you're marching to the Sacred Lands or to the<03e0>gates of the underworld itself, it doesn't matter. We're<03e0>brothers now<07f0>together 'til the end!<04e0>Awright! Time to take a deep breath and knock that<03e0>Conqueror from here to next Tuesday!
Heya, Rush.<04e0>What's the deal with that sovani, Leucetius?<04e0>He busted in here all, "If you won't make me leader,<03e0>I'll take the position myself!"<04e0>It wasn't much trouble to chase him off, though.
It's been some time since the Congress elected the<03e0>Duke of Ghor as the new chairman, but still...<04e0>I'm continually astonished at how he can work people<03e0>so hard.
Hrm, the Conqueror still lives...<04e0>Well, getting worked up won't help anyone think of a<03e0>good way to solve this problem.<04e0>For now, let's take it day by day... Do what we can<03e0>and don't worry about the rest just yet, Rush.
Ever since her father recovered, Miss Irina has been<03e0>quite engrossed in Remnant research. It seems the skill<03e0>runs in the family.<04e0>You and Miss Irina have grown so quickly!<03e0>Ahh, to be young again...
If this trend of illnesses continues,<03e0>I worry for Lord David's health...
As if the Conqueror wasn't enough of a headache, now<03e0>there's even more to deal with... For now, we should<03e0>report to Chairman Ghor and let him deal with this.
Those dark lights surrounding Koenigsdorf...<04e0>Whatever is at each of those locations will do its worst<03e0>to prevent us from getting to the Conqueror.<04e0>From now on, our battles will be fierce. Let's make<03e0>certain we are amply prepared before we proceed.
It's said the mysterious Darken Forest has two very<03e0>different faces.<04e0>One a beautiful, sun-dappled grove, the other a dank,<03e0>smothering wildwood out of a nightmare...<04e0>It's rumored that within the forest is an unbound<03e0>Remnant, spawning many monsters. We should go<03e0>after Miss Irina right away!
The imperial city of Undelwalt is an ancient and storied<03e0>city.<04e0>Once it was a bustling metropolis like Elysion, but ever<03e0>since the Congress was formed, the God Emperor's<03e0>influence has waned, and with it, the might of the city.<04e0>To be honest, Undelwalt feels a bit run-down.
Rush... Since meeting you, we and Lord David have all<03e0>changed a great deal.<04e0>From being preoccupied with the affairs of a single small<03e0>city, we've somehow come to be at the forefront of a<03e0>battle that affects the future of the entire world.<04e0>It's a bit of a change in scale, to say the least.<03e0>It's thanks to you that our horizons have been broadened<03e0>so, and for that you have my deepest appreciation.<04e0>...Anyhow! It's well past time for the final showdown,<03e0>isn't it? Let's finish off the Conqueror, once and for all!
It's imperative that we find a new Remnant to<03e0>restore the faith of the Athlum people as soon<03e0>as possible.<04e0>Without the Valeria Heart, the unease of the<03e0>people is palpable.
To think, the Conqueror's lackeys survived...<04e0>I'm certain the Congress will move to take<03e0>action, but we must stay on our guard.
While Chairman Ghor does tend to act as soon<03e0>as the idea hits, this sudden Congress session<03e0>seems based on an actual emergency.<04e0>Granted, this is all supposition based on what<03e0>little can be gleaned from a visistone<03e0>recording...
It is unheard of for the Lords to be absent at a session<03e0>of the Congress. I cannot help but have a bad feeling<03e0>about this...
That uneasy feeling only increases, day by day... I can<03e0>only hope that I am overestimating the gravity of this<03e0>situation.
Extrapolating from Miss Irina's words, the<03e0>locations signified by those black points are, like<03e0>Hermeien, imbued with the power of a Remnant.<04e0>The thought that there are multiple bearers of<03e0>such strength is distressing at best. For now,<03e0>we must extinguish the threats one by one.
Darken Forest is a wood that corresponds to<03e0>reality. It can change its very form in response<03e0>to the man brave<07f0>or foolish<07f0>enough to enter it.<04e0>That is an ancient sovani saying.<04e0>Upon entering the forest, you will be able to<03e0>feel the movement of the trees. Surely we will<03e0>be able to feel Miss Irina's strong will as well.
Independence for Athlum was the deepest wish<03e0>of the former Marquis.<04e0>For it to have come to pass in this way, while<03e0>muchly due to David's efforts, is also due to<03e0>your help.
Of late I have been surprised to see the rate of Lord<03e0>David's development.<04e0>At first I thought he'd finally gained the former Marquis's<03e0>spirit...but no. He's learnt more than that through these<03e0>harrowing battles.<04e0>I do not know exactly how, but it's due to you, Rush.<03e0>Walking this path with you has allowed him to grow in<03e0>ways we could not teach him.<04e0>Together, let us face the Conqueror, and defeat him.<03e0>And afterwards...please, continue to be at David's side.
An unknown Remnant at Fornstrand...<04e0>Well, it's known of now... No doubt some shady types<03e0>are going to go after it. Don't let down your guard, Rush.
Rush! Good to hear about your dad.<04e0>But...seems no good news comes without bad news<03e0>coming on its heels...<04e0>I didn't even imagine the Conqueror was still alive...<03e0>I will get revenge for Mother, I swear it!
Did you see your sister's expression when you suggested<03e0>she come along?<04e0>I'd never seen her that happy. Seems she's wanted to be<03e0>with you<07f0>or be accepted by you<07f0>for a while.<04e0>Don't worry, we Generals aren't going to let anything<03e0>happen to her!
It's awfully strange for all the Lords to get sick at the<03e0>same time. I have a bad feeling about this.
Duke Qubine was talking about feeling someone else's<03e0>thoughts...what was that all about?<04e0>We'd better keep our wits about us, alright, Rush?<03e0>Don't get careless!
I can't believe Hermeien appeared in Ghor... And Irina<03e0>said he had the same strange aura as those black<03e0>points on the Remnant locator.<04e0>No doubt he's completely bonkers...and all the more<03e0>dangerous because of it.<04e0>Rush, don't underestimate him.
Irina's always been so responsible... There's got to be<03e0>a good reason for her to have gone someplace like<03e0>Darken Forest all by herself.<04e0>That said, it's not like she had to go alone. No matter<03e0>what the reason was, all of us would've been willing<03e0>to help.<04e0>No use saying this to you, hmm? Instead, let's hurry<03e0>and get Irina back.
Rush! It seems Athlum's already taken its first step<03e0>towards independence.<04e0>I think...even Mother can hear everyone's happy cries.<03e0>If I listen closely, I think I can hear hers.
Ever since Mother died, and I became one of the<03e0>Generals of Athlum, I've dreamt of getting revenge<03e0>on the Conqueror.<04e0>I thought that killing him would avenge her, and that<03e0>was enough for me.<04e0>But, after spending all this time with you, I can't help<03e0>but think that thought was awfully small-minded.<04e0>Solely thinking of revenge probably isn't going to<03e0>change the world<07f0>not for the better, at least. It<03e0>probably will only spawn some other act of violence.<04e0>And I'm tired of this endless fighting. This cycle needs<03e0>to end. So, more than revenge, that's why I want to<03e0>stop the Conqueror.<04e0>You've helped me open my eyes to the bigger picture,<03e0>Rush. I appreciate it.
Hello there, Rush.<04e0>Oh yes, some incredibly rude sovani came through here<03e0>not too long ago; wanted to be made leader of our party<03e0>or some such nonsense.<04e0>I tried to tell him that there was nothing I could do about<03e0>it, but he just wouldn't listen. In the end, I had to beat<03e0>some sense into him.
Hey, you two, if things get hairy, just run away, got it?
Alternate routes to the Sacred Lands...<03e0>Well, that place is so linked to Remnants, stands to<03e0>reason there's at least one other way to get up there...
Once all this is over with, how about we all return to<03e0>Eulam, huh? Buck up, kiddo, we're on the home stretch.
Rush, Irina...<03e0>Please take care of yourselves.
A Remnant to travel to the Sacred Lands...<04e0>Fath<07f0>er, I mean, Oswald might know something.
Rush...Irina...<03e0>No matter what happens, we'll always be a family.<03e0>Never forget that.
Rush, I'll do what I can!<04e0>But don't worry<07f0>I'll run if things get<03e0>too dangerous.
A Remnant to go to the Sacred Lands?<04e0>The people of the Academy may know something.
Rush...<04e0>When this is all over, we're all going home<03e0>safe and sound, right?<03e0>Promise?

So we've had another traveler come through town<07f003e0>not a cutie like you, though! He said he came from some<03e0>con-grass whozawhatzit group?<04e0>He went on about his organization bein' updated, with<03e0>some new feller in charge, like it was some of my<03e0>business...<04e0>I didn't even know there were organizations like that, but<03e0>so long as he wasn't asking for any money, it didn't<03e0>bother me none.

Oh, it's you again, come back to visit. You'd better keep<03e0>on going through, hon. Somebody's done taken the<03e0>Brimuslabus, can you believe it?<04e0>The Brimuslabus's stood here for hundreds of years,<03e0>sealin' away an evil god.<04e0>Without the Remnant, that god'll be back...and all the<03e0>madder for it, I'll tell you what.<04e0>Our poor village, this's gonna be the end...
Hoo-wee, can ya believe it? We were saved from that<03e0>terrible disaster by Mr. Wyngale and his posse.<04e0>Phew, I didn't know what to do, I don't even know<03e0>how to start to thank him. I was prayin' to every god I<03e0>could think of!
[[6th level message]](after the Remnant is stolen)
I reckon you saw them giant spikes stickin' out of the<03e0>cliff down yonder. That's our Remnant, the Brimuslabus.<04e0>Town legend says there was some terrible monster<03e0>running wild, but the Imperator took the Remnant and<03e0>sealed it in that very spot.<04e0>'Course, that was hundreds of years ago... If'n there's<03e0>any truth to it, I sure ain't the one to tell. Only<03e0>half-believe it myself, actually.
The Brimuslabus is gone.<04e0>I'm worried<07f0>real worried.<03e0>Sure hope the town legend is nothing more<03e0>than a fancy bedtime story.

Oh, get this. Some fancy-pants messenger strolled in<03e0>from some far-off place. ...Reckon most everyplace is<03e0>pretty far-off from here, though.<04e0>Apparently those big city-types've been havin' themselves<03e0>a war or two, and lost all their Remnants, so, they sent a<03e0>guy to come sniffing 'round here for unbound ones.<04e0>You can bet I gave him the evil eye 'til he gave up on<03e0>tryin' to take the Brimuslabus, I tell you what.<04e0>The nerve of them city folk, comin' here to steal our<03e0>Remnant! They'd just let that varmint sealed by the<03e0>Imperator come back, huh?

I'll be a monkey's uncle. That story 'bout the demon and<03e0>the Imperator was the honest truth after all.<04e0>Damnation, 'til now we been able to drive off everyone<03e0>tryin' to get their hands on the Brimuslabus. How in<03e0>blazes did this happen?<04e0>Welp, ain't nothin' to be done about it now. I was raised<03e0>here by my pappy and him by his pappy before that. I'm<03e0>stayin' here 'til the end.
Hey, have ya heard?<03e0>Some terrible big beast showed up here, an' that sovani,<03e0>Wyngale, beat the tar out of it!<04e0>All this time I figgered he was just some crazy kook,<03e0>who'd have thunk he'd end up all o' our saviors?

A couple times a year, a caravan of traders rolls through.<03e0>They come selling all kinds of equipment and other<03e0>exotic stuff from the east.<04e0>Some o' them traders were saying there's s'posed to be<03e0>some huge cities, a couple times bigger than here, even.<04e0>Speaking plainly, I think they were just pulling my leg.<03e0>Like someplace that big could really exist, come on,<03e0>I'm no idiot!

Hoo-wee, was I surprised!<04e0>Some feller from the east<07f0>called himself an emissary<03e0>or somesuch<07f0>came all the way out here to Grentze<03e0>from the capital city, Elysion.<04e0>Seems the folks on the continent all got into some<03e0>fightin', and lost a bunch of their Remnants. Shame,<03e0>ain't it?<04e0>Anyhow, I guess the world's pretty big after all.<03e0>Kinda makes me wanna strike out and do some<03e0>explorin' myself!

Whoa there, pardner! This ain't no place to be<03e0>lollygagging!<04e0>Didn't you know? The legendary beast what was<03e0>sealed around here's woken up!<04e0>There ain't nothin' left for this town, sure as<03e0>I'm standin' here<07f0>so I'm hoofing it out. Dunno<03e0>where I'm headin', but it can't be worse.
Hey, pardner<07f0>izzit true what they say, that the<03e0>varmint what was s'posed to destroy the village was<03e0>beaten?<04e0>I heard tell that square peg of a sovani what lived<03e0>here came in with his pals an' saved the village.<03e0>Pretty amazin', ain't it?<04e0>I was on the road outta town when I heard the<03e0>rumor, so I came back t' check it out.
See that sovani knight standin' over by the cliffs?<03e0>That's Mr. Wyngale.<04e0>Mama says he's protected Grentze for a long, long<03e0>time<07f0>even since before I was born!

Mr. Wyngale stands there every day and prays towards<03e0>the Brimuslabus.<04e0>Wonder if his arms get tired, standin' like that all the<03e0>time...<04e0>I'd go and switch off with him so he could rest, but I<03e0>haven't got but two arms...

Mister, what're we gonna do?<04e0>The Brimuslabus is gone, and Mama says some real<03e0>scary monster's come out!<04e0>Mr. Wyngale'll be able to do somethin' about it...right?
Hey, mister, didja see? That scary monster ain't here no<03e0>more. Mr. Wyngale found it and whupped it but good!<03e0>He's just amazing!<04e0>When I grow up, I wanna be just like him!
I am Wyngale.<04e0>I've stood here for hundreds of years, watching over<03e0>the Remnant Brimuslabus and what it seals.
Foolish qsiti.<03e0>The Brimuslabus has not blessed this town.<04e0>Or perhaps, it has.<03e0>Perhaps it has prevented Him from awakening.<03e0>That would indeed be a blessing.<04e0>Hmph...
Huh?<03e0>What're you doing here, old lady?
Wha<07f0>excuse me?<03e0>Do I even know you?
Oh, oops.<03e0>Um, I thought you were someone else...
Hmph! Make sure you have the right<03e0>person next time!
S-sorry...
Hmph... I'll let it slide this time. Of course, that's on<03e0>the condition that there's never a second.
Calling someone "old lady" is rude and inconsiderate...<03e0>especially when they aren't old!
Hm? You again.
Uh.
You don't look happy to see me.
Uh, n-no, that's not true!<03e0>Say, ol<07f0>O beautiful young maid, what're you doing<03e0>around here?
Training.<03e0>In my family, it's a rite of passage to travel the world.
Huh... Sounds pretty tough.<03e0>Take care of yourself, okay?
...Ahh. Thank you.
You're not as inconsiderate as I thought.
You're looking well.
Heya, Ms. Young Maiden.
...Right. So, could you please not call me that?<03e0>It's rather bothersome, to be honest.
Well, it's not like I know your name.
Oh?
...
The name's Emmy.
Nice to meet you for real, finally. I'm<07f001e00be00ae0>
Rush. Rush Sykes.<03e0>Right?
Wha<07f0>? How did you know!?
I have my ways.
Take care, Rush.
What's the purpose of my training?<03e0>Well...a lot of things. But in general,<03e0>training the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.
What's the purpose of my training?<03e0>Well...a lot of things. But in general,<03e0>training the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.
You're still searching for your sister, aren't you?<03e0>I wish there was something I could do to help...
You're still searching for your sister, aren't you?<03e0>I wish there was something I could do to help...
Of course I keep in touch with my family.<03e0>That's how I know about you.
Of course I keep in touch with my family.<03e0>That's how I know about you.
I thought I'd done plenty of training, but I still can't<03e0>even light a candle to Mother... But there's no way<03e0>I'm giving up now.
I thought I'd done plenty of training, but I still can't<03e0>even light a candle to Mother... But there's no way<03e0>I'm giving up now.
Ohh, Rush.<04e0>Finally, I'm free.<03e0>Finally, the time has come when I can kill that man!
Who do I mean?<04e0>Who indeed? Could be anyone.<03e0>Could be someone you know very well...<03e0>Heheheheh...
Heheheheh...
I was chained to the Brimuslabus hundreds of years<03e0>ago... Back when the Imperator still ruled the world.<04e0>You don't believe me?<03e0>Heheheh...<04e0>The bastard was...unpleasant, to say the least.<03e0>I infuriated him because of my awesome strength<03e0>and the fact that he couldn't break my spirit.<04e0>So when he ran out of use for me, he forced me<03e0>to bind the Brimuslabus and act as the Fallen's seal.<04e0>What a pitiful man he was.<03e0>Heh heh heh...
Heh heh heh...
Rush...<04e0>It's...it's beginning to come back to me...<03e0>The person I was then...<04e0>Working with the Imperator, fighting for the Imperator.<03e0>Fighting all the time...<03e0>Anger...destruction...chaos...death...<04e0>It was so much fun.<03e0>The best days I've ever spent...<04e0>And then...that man...<03e0>The Imperator himself tried to snatch it all away!<03e0>But now...now we see who's truly won...<04e0>Muh...muh...mwa-hahahahaha!!!
Mwa-hahahahaha!!!
Before he left me here, he told me something...<03e0>"We'll meet again if the fates allow."<04e0>Heh heh heh...<04e0>I can feel it...feel it strongly.<03e0>The feel of his soul, not fully claimed by death...<04e0>Wait for me, spirit wandering the space between<03e0>heaven and earth. Wait, because I'm going to find<03e0>you and destroy you.<04e0>There won't even be a sliver of soul left when I'm<03e0>done with you!<04e0>Finally, you'll regret what you've done!<03e0>Bwah-hahahahahahah!!!
Rush! I feel amazing!<04e0>When you go to battle, make sure you tell me. Got it?<03e0>Don't you dare go without me!
Rush...<03e0>This time at last, all my bonds have been released...<03e0>But... I just don't understand this feeling of emptiness...
Heya, Rush.<04e0>Sorry I kinda tricked ya into helping Baaluk.<03e0>But I really appreciate the help, honest!
Hey! You're not still mad at me, are you? I know I went<03e0>about things the wrong way so we kinda got off on the<03e0>wrong foot...<04e0>B-but, anyway, from now on I'm totally committed to<03e0>doing anything to help out Baaluk! So go on, gimme an<03e0>order! I'm all ears!<04e0>I'm all ready to go, so just say the word!
I'm gonna help out as hard as I can!<03e0>Any time you wanna head out, just say the word!
Huh? Ah<07f0>R-Rush...<04e0>H-hey, how's it going, did you need something?<04e0>Hm? Something wrong<07f0>with me?<03e0>N-no, of course not! Not a bit! Ahahahah...<04e0>A-anyway, it's not time to go already, is it? If we've<03e0>still got some time, maybe you could give me a moment<03e0>alone...
H-hey, Rush. Is it time to go already?<03e0>If not, maybe you could leave me alone for a minute...
Rush...<03e0>I think...I've been tricked.<04e0>Maybe all of us have. And I think it's all my fault...<04e0>Yanno, the one who told me that the Brimuslabus was<03e0>about to Collapse was that guy Wyngale.<04e0>He's always been calm and serious, always acting with<03e0>the town's best interests at heart. But ever since they<03e0>took the Brimuslabus, it's like he totally changed...<04e0>Or maybe he's just showing his true colors. Maybe he<03e0>never cared about Baaluk at all in the first place...<04e0>And what's more, you know those guys we gave the<03e0>Remnant to? I have this really, really bad feeling about<03e0>them...<04e0>Oh man, what if all this time I've been acting high and<03e0>mighty, thinking I was the town's hero, when really I've<03e0>just been playing right into the bad guys's hands?<04e0>Augh, we don't even have a Remnant anymore! What's<03e0>going to happen to Baaluk now? ...I don't know what I'll<03e0>do if something awful happens...
What's going to happen to Baaluk now?<03e0>I don't know what I'll do if something awful happens...
There are towns that don't have Remnants?<03e0>And you're from one of them!?<03e0>Wow!<04e0>Then maybe Baaluk will be okay too!<03e0>Just maybe...<04e0>Thanks, Rush!<03e0>Thanks for telling me and giving me hope!<04e0>I said some awful things about Wyngale...<03e0>I don't know why I doubted him. I need to have<03e0>more faith in people and what they can do...<04e0>But now's not the time to dwell on the past.<03e0>It's time to turn Baaluk into a town everyone<03e0>wants to live in!
Okay, Rush, you've got me fired up!<04e0>I'm gonna work to make Baaluk a town everyone wants<03e0>to live in<07f0>even if it doesn't have a Remnant!
There's some power coming from the remains<03e0>of the Brimuslabus...something strong... I can't<03e0>believe this happened. I only wanted to help Baaluk...<04e0>...<04e0>Yeah... Maybe...this really is my fault.<03e0>And if so, I've gotta do something to help!<04e0>Rush<07f0>I've gotta bring back the Brimuslabus.<03e0>I mean, if everything's back to how it was before,<03e0>that's gotta make everything okay, right?<04e0>I know that you don't really have time to look into<03e0>what the Academy is doing, but what you are doing<03e0>doesn't seem that far off to me...<04e0>So...please, continue to let me fight with you.<03e0>Even if it's roundabout...I've gotta do something!
Rush!<03e0>Have you heard anything from the Academy?
What? Do you need something?
Something wrong?
Have you seen Lord David?<04e0>I do not feel comfortable letting him alone.<03e0>If you see him, please tell him I am looking for him.
Troublemaker...
...
On the surface, it does not seem like this place has<03e0>changed very much...<04e0>That said, it is no place to let Lord David run about<03e0>unsupervised. If you see him, tell him I am looking<03e0>for him.
You haven't seen Lord David?
If it was only going to be stolen anyway,<03e0>we should have taken the Remnant ourselves...<04e0>...No, Lord David would never have stood for it.
Please forget I said anything.
And we must assume the Conqueror is even<03e0>more powerful than that monster...
...
The Remnant Ark...<03e0>Surely there must be a similar Remnant elsewhere<03e0>in the world...
I can think of nothing...
Lord David is as prepared as he can be.<04e0>All I have to do is to follow.
Ahh...what a spectacular Remnant.<03e0>It just has a certain mystique, doesn't it?<03e0>I feel as if I'd never tire of looking at it...<04e0>However...it does look a bit like a pincushion,<03e0>doesn't it...
Incredible...
...
After learning of Remnants disappearing the world<03e0>over, I'd become a bit wary, but look. This place is the<03e0>same as always...it's a small but appreciated blessing.
Yes, yes.
Then, it's just like Athlum...<04e0>The whole mood of the town is different.
What in the world is going on?
I lived through it yet can hardly believe it...<04e0>To think that such a fiend existed in this world...!
...
It must exist, somewhere...
Let's continue to search.
Let's finish this...learn the true ending of this tale.
Come and check out the weapons they have!<03e0>Ahh, from blunt to sharp, fancy decorative stuff<03e0>to everyday weapons, I love 'em all!
Heheheheh...
Lady Emma...
Heya, Rush! Check it out<07f0>the Remnant's still alive<03e0>and kicking! So we can't get all down either, right?
We can't lose hope now!
Even the weapons seem kinda pooped out...<03e0>Guess it's 'coz the Remnant's gone...
Geez, even the weapons seem pooped out...
The heck was that all about?<04e0>Geez, at least we won.<03e0>Don't gotta worry about that thing anymore!
Don't gotta worry about that thing anymore!
If I have to think about this Remnant stuff any more,<03e0>my head's gonna explode! You just tell me where<03e0>to go when you've figured it out, okay?
I'm ready to rock whenever!
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>Don't worry<07f0>I'll knock down anybody in our way!
What am I doing?<04e0>Just as it looks, taking a walk. As the Marquis, I can't<03e0>just roam the streets alone in Athlum or Celapaleis...<04e0>I'm certain Torgal is having conniptions, but let's keep<03e0>this between us, shall we?
Remember<07f0>this is our secret.
This town's Remnant still stands.
...
Here as well...<04e0>It is not only Athlum that's lost its Remnant...
...
To think, something like that was sealed by the<03e0>Brimuslabus...<04e0>We're lucky nothing like that was sealed beneath<03e0>the Valeria Heart...
...
What am I rushing around for?<03e0>To be honest, I was mainly trying not to be recognized...
I hope we're not too late...
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>And we'll return together<07f0>victorious!
The town may look the same as always,<03e0>but that's only at first glance.<04e0>There's plenty of rumbling beneath the surface...<03e0>This is no time to start slacking.
This place is rotten...
They've lost their Remnant as well...<03e0>I suppose it could be just coincidence...<04e0>Certainly seems like a plot, though...
I can't believe someone isn't behind all this...
Good god... A Remnant powerful enough to seal a<03e0>beast like that<07f0>what kind of being was able to handle<03e0>that sort of power?
...
Hey now, quit playing around and help us search, will<03e0>you? There's got to be another way to get to the<03e0>Sacred Lands, but we won't find it if you don't look.
Don't worry<07f0>we'll find it.
I'll look after Lord David since she cannot...<03e0>So you'd better do the same for Irina.

Chee!<03e0>I think I've seen something I shouldn't have...!<04e0>You seem the curious type, but curiosity killed<03e0>the qsiti<07f0>almost, anyhow! Who'd have thought<03e0>such a thing lurked in the Yvalock's Nest?<04e0>To begin with, all the Yvalocks were supposed<03e0>to have been wiped out ages ago! But what I<03e0>met in that cave was far from dead...<04e0>Waaah, I won't be sleeping a wink tonight!
He-llo... So, you crossed the Vale of the Gods all by<03e0>your lonesome?

Well, well! It's been a spell since we've had a new face.<03e0>Welcome to the Rift!
All the mess that guy talks, and when it's actually<03e0>dangerous, that's when he actually follows through?<03e0>Foolish old man...<04e0>And what's up with leaving that ridiculous letter?<04e0>"Not trying to cause trouble"<07f0>more like "there's<03e0>nothing you can do to stop me"!
I saw you and Wyngale fight that giant monster.<04e0>Thanks.
I saw you and Wyngale fight that giant monster.<04e0>Thanks. I'm sure the old man's laughing his head off<03e0>up past the pearly gates.
Hey! Howdy, traveler! Don't see many like you<03e0>'round these parts. Sit and drink a spell!
Well I'll be! It's been a spell since I've had a<03e0>customer. What can I do you for, sir?
What's this? You, you are an unfamiliar face.<03e0>Doing a bit of traveling, sport?<04e0>Take a seat, have some tea. At least it doesn't have<03e0>any problems with it... I'm the owner here, and you<03e0>wouldn't believe the troubles I've had.<04e0>I actually started out in Balterossa. Never have to<03e0>worry about having too few customers there, eh?<03e0>It's pricey though. I couldn't turn a profit.<04e0>So...that's how I ended up out here on<03e0>the edge of the world.
Sad thing is<07f0>and this is where it really adds insult to<03e0>injury<07f0>even this tiny pub out in the boonies couldn't<03e0>be run all alone.<04e0>So...I was desperate. I went to town, found two guys<03e0>who looked like they didn't have anything else to do,<03e0>and hired 'em. Talk about an epic failure!<04e0>Where do I start? The younger guy's a lazy dog. I've<03e0>seen corpses that're more productive, ugh. But you<03e0>know how mitra can be...no offense.<04e0>Then the old guy, bless him, he's enthusiastic enough,<03e0>but completely incompetent. Can't remember customer<03e0>orders for the life of him.<04e0>The customers themselves are mostly down-and-out<03e0>mercenaries, so not really the type you wanna get too<03e0>friendly with, you know?<04e0>*sigh*<04e0>I always dreamed of having a bustling pub full of<03e0>attractive patrons having stimulating conversations<03e0>about adventure and intrigue...
Ach, sorry, sorry. You come in here for a drink and<03e0>then I end up talking your ear off.<04e0>Anyway, next time you come out here, come back and<03e0>visit, alright? There'll be a hot pot of tea waiting for<03e0>you, my treat.
In addition to an impressive selection of wines and<03e0>spirits, here at The Rift we offer tea with every order.<04e0>The tea leaves are imported from Melphina<07f0>and<03e0>don't think it doesn't cost a fortune.<04e0>Still, thanks to that, we keep a steady stream of<03e0>customers all day long. ...Er, until recently, anyhow.
Hey, sport! How's it going? You would not believe what's<03e0>been going on with me lately, it's just terrible, terrible.<03e0>See<07f004e0>...You don't wanna listen? You have to go?<04e0>Oh. I...I see.
Ohh! Heya, sport!<04e0>Yanno, when I heard some legendary monster'd been<03e0>reborn or whatever, I was all ready to close up shop.<03e0>Damn shame too, after coming all this way and all...<04e0>So you can imagine my relief to find that you guys<03e0>took care of all the trouble! Talk about good news!<03e0>I guess I like this town more than I thought.
Hey, someone else from the "outside." I'm not from<03e0>here either... Last year I was hired to escort a guy out<03e0>here.<04e0>Thing is, once we made it to town, the guy disappeared<03e0>without paying me!<04e0>I've been trapped here since then... I'm just working<03e0>to make enough cash to get out of this hole.<04e0>Nothing happens here at all...this place is like a complete<03e0>waste of space. I can't wait to get the hell out!
Oh, hey, outsider.<03e0>Don't worry about the dishes, alright?<04e0>I finally saved up enough to leave Grentze, but I think<03e0>I'm gonna hang around a little bit longer.<04e0>I mean, look at these people. Leaving them alone is like<03e0>sending a bunch of toddlers to face the Ghor army.<03e0>I'm not that cruel!
Oh man... So apparently, this legendary god-demon<03e0>thing<07f0>no one here can decide which<07f0>has been<03e0>awakened. People are going bananas.<04e0>Geez, I guess it's up to me to take care of everyone...<03e0>I mean, I am a mercenary, after all. Fighting's what I do.<04e0>And I'll fight to protect this town!
Wyngale stole my gig!<03e0>Didn't I say I was gonna be protecting Grentze?<04e0>...Heh, psych. I tried heading over there and my knees<03e0>started shaking like they were gonna give out...<03e0>Thought I was gonna die just looking at the thing.<04e0>Seriously, Wyngale is this town's hero.
You again?<04e0>I'm on break, alright? Leave me alone.
You again.<04e0>Look. I can understand why you'd want to talk to<03e0>me<07f0>I know how impressionable young boys are,<03e0>but break time is me-time, alright?<04e0>...<04e0>...The hell is that stupid expression for?<03e0>Oh, don't tell me...<03e0>You don't have the slightest idea who I am, do you?<04e0>Well, damn.<03e0>I didn't know people like you even existed.
You have no idea who I am, do you?<03e0>I didn't know they made kids like you anymore.
Hey.<03e0>Seriously, you've never heard of me?<04e0>Not to toot my own horn, but in the world of mercenaries,<03e0>I'm known as the King.<04e0>Sure, I figured downgrading from war contracts to little<03e0>jobs like this might get me ragged on or something,<03e0>but an employer who doesn't know me from Adam?<04e0>...Whatever. Just looking at you I can tell you're just a<03e0>little puppy, still suckling at his mama's teat, eh?<03e0>How 'bout it then, why don't you test your hand?<04e0>Gotta warn you, though<07f0>just a bout or two of<03e0>sparring ain't gonna bless you with my luck in battle.<03e0>Hahahahaha!<04e0>...<04e0>...You could at least pretend to look interested.
Not to toot my own horn, but when it comes to<03e0>mercenaries, I'm known as the King.<03e0>C'mon, how 'bout you show me your moves?
Pup, you're back!<03e0>You ready to show me what you've got?<04e0>...What, now you look like someone stole your last<03e0>bone. Don't like being called a little puppy, do you?<04e0>Don't get me wrong, kid, I'm not trying to put you<03e0>down to look big or anything.<04e0>In fact, you got a good look in your eye... I can tell<03e0>you're a fighter. Let's focus that...make you<03e0>actually worth something.<04e0>Whaddaya think of that, me as your teacher?<03e0>If you ask me, I think you should feel honored.<04e0>What, you doubt my skill? You think I'm full of it?<03e0>Feh. Think what you want. So what're you gonna<03e0>do about it?<04e0>If you know someone who thinks they could beat me,<03e0>bring 'em on. I'll show 'em how strong<07f0>or weak<07f0>they<03e0>really are. Hahahahaha!
Heya, pup!<03e0>You know someone who thinks they can beat me?<03e0>Bring 'em on! I'll show them the error of their ways.
You again? You seriously don't understand the point<03e0>of time off, do you? Just let me rest, ugh. I feel like<03e0>the Sacred Lands fell on me.<04e0>This's all your doing, isn't it? Some yama in a mask<03e0>comes up to challenge me to a fight<07f0>come on, like<03e0>I wouldn't know it's Duke Ghor.<04e0>He was carrying the Bilqis, for crying out loud. What<03e0>the hell kind of idiots is he used to dealing with?<04e0>Damn... Thanks to that, I can't feel my face...<04e0>Sorry, Rush. I took a little bruise to my pride and let<03e0>it blow up into all this mess.<04e0>Guess I shouldn't slack on my training either. Whaddya<03e0>think, Rush, you up for some lessons? I wasn't lying<03e0>when I said I saw a lot of potential in you.<04e0>Of course, the number one thing a mercenary needs<03e0>is strength! So the first thing we gotta do is eat!<03e0>Hahahahahahaha!!!
Rush. We got some time off, eh? You up for some<03e0>training? Or maybe we can grab a bite to eat.
Words are written on a stained, yellowed paper.<03e0>It seems to be a letter.<04e0>"Grentze is in danger, and it's up to me to defend it.<03e0>  So I'm off to defeat the Fallen (somehow)!<04e0>  I'm not trying to cause trouble for the bartender or<03e0>  nothing, but I can't sit idly by while the world<03e0>  is in trouble.<04e0>  But don't worry! I called my twin brother from<03e0>  Balterossa to take care of things. You won't even<03e0>  know I'm gone! Except for this letter, I guess.<04e0>  All righty, so here I go! Even if I can't give that thing<03e0>  more than a paper cut, I'll make sure it's one that<03e0>  stings! Gahahaha!"

Izzat so. And?
I can't believe they didn't send me a personal<03e0>invitation! You'd think I'd be in high demand, eh?<03e0>Gahahahaha!

...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
And, when it comes to skilled magi, how can you<03e0>not think of me? We should be hearing back from<03e0>the Academy soon, eh? Gahahahaha!

...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
OooOOOooo, scary, innit?<03e0>Gahahahaha!

I'll take care of this!<03e0>...Right after finishing the dishes, that is.<03e0>Gahahahaha!
Young adventurers have gotten into trading the<03e0>different loot they find on their trips these days.<03e0>Seems Royotia's the main hub for the fad.

Izzat so. And?

A looker like me shouldn't have any trouble giving<03e0>her what she's looking for, eh? Gahahahaha!
You've probably seen them if you've been hanging<03e0>around Crookfen, but Bloody Alice has been<03e0>gathering. Looks like something big's going on...
...That's the scuttlebutt, anyhoo!
Izzat so. And?
And so of course they're meeting up since they're<03e0>all fans of me! Gahahahaha!
Seems the Jhana have been popping up in the Great<03e0>Sand Sea. You wouldn't think they'd have forgotten<03e0>being blasted by the Gae Bolg already...

Baaluk is currently without a lord.<03e0>The two sons of the previous lord do nothing but<03e0>argue over who is more fit for the position...<04e0>The closest we've got to a ruler is Wyngale. He's<03e0>protected this town for a long time. But without<03e0>a lord, who knows when there might be a Collapse?
This Brimuslabus is gone...<03e0>I pray that things will change for the better.
It's hard to believe it's come to this... But I was born and<03e0>raised in this town. Reckon I'll stay with it to the end.<04e0>It's like all the stories said... The Brimuslabus was the<03e0>guardian angel to us all...
There is no way we can ever fully thank Wyngale for what<03e0>he's done.<04e0>The Brimuslabus may be gone, but there's still a future<03e0>for this town...it's one we're all willing to work together<03e0>to make.
The next leader of Baaluk is gonna be me! My<03e0>little brother's such an idiot he tried milking<03e0>bulls! Like I'm gonna leave Baaluk to him!
The next leader of Baaluk is gonna be me!<03e0>But so long as the Brimuslabus's gone, I gotta<03e0>figure something out to take care of this fix we're in...
I figure I was acting like a kid before. Wyngale saved<03e0>the town and gave us a second chance...<03e0>I'm gonna cooperate with my little bro from now on.
I-I'm going to be the next ruler of Baaluk... I<03e0>hope! My older brother is too hot-headed... I-I<03e0>don't want to leave the Brimuslabus to him!
I can hardly believe this is happening...
I can't tell you how many nights I spent with my<03e0>brother, trying to figure out how to save the town...<04e0>And that's when I realized just how much he<03e0>cares about Baaluk, and what he'd sacrifice for it...<04e0>From now on, we're gonna think of how we can<03e0>help out the village<07f0>together.

Oh my! It seems that Athlum has had its Valeria Heart<03e0>stolen by that wretched Conqueror! It's the buzz of the<03e0>town, to be honest.<04e0>Just the thought of the Umbermarici disappearing is<03e0>depressing. I wonder, are the people of Athlum okay?
My goodness... There's so much to worry about<03e0>nowadays it's hard to even sleep!<04e0>Why? ...You don't know!? Poor Duke Qubine<03e0>has fallen ill!<04e0>According to the travelers on the Way, he's<03e0>grown weaker every day...<04e0>Damnation, is there nothing we can do?

I never imagined the Conqueror's forces were<03e0>that strong...!<04e0>I was on guard duty here while my wounded<03e0>comrades were brought back from battle...<03e0>It was like some story about the end of days...<04e0>Lord Qubine has ordered a strengthening of all<03e0>forces, so all the shopkeepers have upgraded<03e0>their inventory.<04e0>If the Conqueror and his thugs try coming around<03e0>here again, we'll be ready to knock the living<03e0>daylights out of them.
The rumor going around is that that bright light<03e0>from a while back was Nagapur's Remnant going<03e0>crazy and destroying the city.<04e0>I've also heard that Lord Qubine's been feeling<03e0>poorly lately.<04e0>Is Celapaleis going to be destroyed just like<03e0>Nagapur was?

Wha<07f0>excuse me?<03e0>Do I even know you?
Oh, oops.<03e0>Um, I thought you were someone else...
Hmph! Make sure you have the right<03e0>person next time!
S-sorry...
Hmph... I'll let it slide this time. Of course, that's on<03e0>the condition that there's never a second.
Calling someone "old lady" is rude and inconsiderate...<03e0>especially when they aren't old!
Hm? You again.
Uh.
You don't look happy to see me.
Uh, n-no, that's not true!<03e0>Say, ol<07f0>O beautiful young maid, what're you doing<03e0>around here?
Training.<03e0>In my family, it's a rite of passage<03e0>to travel the world.
Huh... Sounds pretty tough.<03e0>Take care of yourself, okay?
...Ahh. Thank you.
You're not as inconsiderate as I thought.
You're looking well.
Heya, Ms. Young Maiden.
Could you please not call me that?<03e0>It sounds ridiculous, to say the least.
Well, it's not like I know your name.
Oh?
...
The name's Emmy.
Nice to meet you for real, finally.<03e0>I'm<07f001e00be00ae0>
Rush. Rush Sykes.<03e0>Right?
Wha<07f0>? How did you know!?
I have my ways.
Take care, Rush.
What's the purpose of my training?<03e0>Well...a lot of things. But in general,<03e0>training the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.

I thought I'd done plenty of training, but I still can't<03e0>even light a candle to Mother... But there's no way<03e0>I'm giving up now.
Ah? Rush...<03e0>Are you doing well?<04e0>I suppose I ought to thank you for last time...<03e0>For the business in Celapaleis, I mean.
I truly enjoy this place. The feel of the buildings,<03e0>the hustle and bustle of the people...<04e0>The country of Gilles-Barre felt like this, once.
This area is so reminiscent of the country of<03e0>Gilles-Barre... The people, the feel of the streets...
Around the time of my father's death, the house<03e0>of Gilles-Barre had taken a terrible fall. I took it<03e0>upon myself to restore the honor of our house.<04e0>...That's why I hated my husband. I resented<03e0>everything he was...<04e0>I knew he cared for me. But how could he know<03e0>how it felt to fall from grace? He wasn't one of us.<03e0>He could never understand my rage...or so I thought.<04e0>Thinking on it now, it's I who didn't understand...
I took it upon myself to restore my family to its<03e0>former glory... Looking back now, I realize I really<03e0>did not understand anything.
Lately, I've been having a strange dream.<04e0>It's of the day the former Duke Qubine died.<03e0>In it, I am returning from the palace, weeping as I go...<04e0>The sun is setting, bathing the whole town in<03e0>a golden red light. Mother holds my hand, and<03e0>Father looks at me with a bitter smile...<04e0>It's been so long. It felt so real. So warm...<04e0>But, that's how I felt until recently, I suppose.<04e0>My father, my mother, my memories... All were<03e0>stolen from me by Duke Qubine. So when he<03e0>died, it was only what he deserved, or so I felt...<04e0>Looking at it with a clear mind, I can see that<03e0>the view then was just as it is now<07f0>beautiful.
In the past and today, this road is beautiful.<03e0>I can see that, now...
Rush...<04e0>For a long time I felt that if only Duke Qubine was<03e0>gone, the Gilles-Barres family would recover its<03e0>land, its riches, and most importantly, its honor.<04e0>But I've finally realized that those things are not<03e0>truly what I've been hoping to get back all this time.<04e0>What I really wanted was my mother and father, and the<03e0>happy times we spent together. That's what I've been<03e0>chasing all this time.<04e0>Odd, isn't it? Even if my house were returned to its<03e0>former standing right now, it would not undo the past....<04e0>The thing I've most wanted is not something I can<03e0>take by force. But at the same time, it's something<03e0>that already exists in my heart.<04e0>It's up to me to keep the memories I have left...<03e0>It's up to me to live up to them.<03e0>I've been a fool...<04e0>...<04e0>Rush...thank you for allowing me to say all this.<03e0>In explaining myself, I feel like I've finally begun to<03e0>heal...
Ah, hello, Rush.<04e0>I'm off to offer flowers at my parents' graves.<03e0>What sort of flowers do you think they would like?
Oh, it's you! Thanks for helping me out earlier.<04e0>If you need any customizations, definitely let<03e0>me know!

Yes...I'm sure of it.<04e0>And being tenacious enough to force herself<03e0>into my consciousness...that definitely seems<03e0>like Kate.<04e0>Rush, if it's alright, I'd like to continue to travel<03e0>with you. Kate does as well, of course. Please, let<03e0>me know anytime you need something.
Hi, Rush!<04e0>I fought with Kate for the first time in a long while.<03e0>It sounds kind of strange, but I really missed it...<03e0>I didn't win, but then again I never have...
What...you looking for a fight?<03e0>Keep gawking at me like that and I'll relieve you<03e0>of your teeth.
What's your problem? You look like you've seen a<03e0>ghost. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I'm 100% flesh<03e0>and blood, pal.
The hell's wrong with you? You look like you<03e0>saw a ghost.
Rhagoh?<03e0>Yeah, we're cool. Nothing for you to worry about.<04e0>Just a bit ago we had a fight over lunch.<03e0>Obviously, I won.<04e0>So, of course we're fine. Isn't that what they say,<03e0>friendship is fighting like cats and dogs?<04e0>...<04e0>Yeah, we're fine...we should be just fine, Rhagoh and me.
Rhagoh and me are getting along just fine.<03e0>Nothing for you to worry your empty little head about,<03e0>anyway.
What do you want? I am not in a good mood. If you<03e0>haven't got a damned good reason to chit-chat,<03e0>I suggest you leave me the hell alone.<04e0>...<04e0>Sorry.<03e0>It's just that<07f0> Hell, I'll just tell you.<04e0>Thing is... I'm not really<07f0>me. I mean, it's not like I'm<03e0>a clone or a ghost or anything ridiculous like that.<04e0>How it worked is that I'm the Kate from Rhagoh's<03e0>memories, made flesh by the Remnant Flâchonelle,<03e0>if that makes any sense, which it probably doesn't.<04e0>Either way, for the most part I'm really Kate, but still<03e0>sort of...not.<04e0>At first, I didn't give a damn. If I was enough for<03e0>Rhagoh, it was enough for me.<04e0>Just, as time's gone on, it's been freaking me out.<03e0>I mean, what if everything I do isn't because I wanna<03e0>do it, but because I'm Rhagoh's idealized vision of me?<04e0>What am I?<03e0>What should I do with myself?<04e0>...<04e0>Huh...guess it's a bitch for you to have to deal with<03e0>this shit, too. But...thanks. It felt good to get some of<03e0>this off my chest.
Thanks for letting me vent. I feel better getting that<03e0>off my chest.
Hey.<04e0>Since we talked last time, I've been spending some<03e0>time away from Rhagoh... Been doing some thinking.<04e0>It was kinda nice to be away. Had me thinking I<03e0>didn't need to be worrying so much after all.<04e0>I am me...and that's okay. Trying to force myself<03e0>to act like somebody else wants is only gonna make<03e0>all of us pissed, eh?<04e0>So, I'm just gonna live as me. Might be a little different<03e0>than what Rhagoh was thinking, but I am Kate and<03e0>Kate's gotta be true to herself.<04e0>...Damn, but this is confusing. Anyway, thanks,<03e0>Rush. Talking with you really helped me sort<03e0>all this out.
Heya, Rush!<03e0>Huhhh, you actually look busy. We can chat later, then.

Welcome to the Sword of Three Realms.
To protect someone of my stature, obviously the most<03e0>skilled of mercenaries are necessary.<04e0>To that end, I always take advantage of the guild here.<03e0>The high prices are no trouble for me<07f0>I have enough<03e0>money to bury the entirety of Lamberro in gold! Ha ha ha!
If the hiring fees look expensive, well, there're good<03e0>reasons for that. I mean, a good merc's got a lot to<03e0>take care of. And I'm not just talking weapon skills.<04e0>Equipment, arts, grace, fancy talk... Classy people are<03e0>looking for all of that before they hire you. It's kinda<03e0>annoying...and pricey to keep up.

Ah, so you're looking to pick up some Guild Tasks,<03e0>too? Eh<07f0>you don't think you can do 'em? Don't worry.<03e0>I'll take you under my wing.<04e0>If it looks like it'll go well, then own it! If the going<03e0>gets tough<07f0>run away! That is some number-one<03e0>top strategery right there, so don't you forget it!
Hey, have you heard? There's some new guild here<03e0>in Lamberro where all the high-level mercs've<03e0>been hanging out.<04e0>The rumor is that there's some secret entrance<03e0>somewhere in the Amber, but they only let the top<03e0>of the top-class guys in. Guess I'll just stay here...
Different towns attract different types of adventurers<03e0>to their guild.<04e0>If you aren't finding the type you're looking for here,<03e0>try checking a different town.<04e0>Once you visit a few other guilds, you'll understand.
You've heard about Siebenbur, right? It's a<03e0>sprawling series of underground caverns...it's<03e0>the talk of all the adventurers lately.<04e0>Some say it was built by one of the God<03e0>Emperors, others say it was carved out by some<03e0>massive beast... No one knows for sure.<04e0>One of the reasons for that is that not so many<03e0>return from Siebenbur<07f0>in one piece, anyway.<04e0>Whether you think you've got skills or no, be<03e0>prepared if you end up going there. The monsters<03e0>there are nothing to sneeze at.

Hello! Welcome to the Amber Tavern.
Some strange animal or something has been seen<03e0>around the stores on Grants Way. Ooh, if something<03e0>like that were to come here, I don't know what I'd do...
Some soldiers came here, looking for someone...<03e0>It wasn't you, was it?
Hmm? What's with that face?<03e0>Did you get in a fight with someone?<03e007f0>A lovers' spat, perhaps?
It seems those soldiers are back again. It seems they've<03e0>a message from the Marquis of Athlum... They're looking<03e0>for you, right? Come on, you can tell me.
You must be a popular guy...<03e0>Messengers from Athlum are looking for you again.<04e0>I figured you were just your run-of-the-mill cutie...<03e0>Don't tell me you're one of Athlum's generals<03e0>or something?
Poo...boring!<04e0>I thought that by getting a job at the pub I'd be<03e0>able to meet all kinds of cool people, but<03e0>everyone who comes lives in the neighborhood!<04e0>Ahhh...it'd be pretty neat if Lord Qubine came<03e0>here for a drink, for example! Though, I guess<03e0>he's a little young...
The rumor going around Grants Way is that<03e0>lots of soldiers have been gathering in Nagapur.<04e0>You don't think they're getting ready for a war<03e0>or something, do you?<04e0>Even if they were, my lovely tavernkeep, you<03e0>have no need to worry! I would protect you with<03e0>my life!
I cannot believe we were so easily overcome by<03e0>the Conqueror's army! Even so, the Conqueror's<03e0>soldiers weren't anything special, hm?<04e0>Oh! Fair bartender, my delicate bringer of<03e0>spirits, did you see my stunning contribution<03e0>to the city defense?<04e0>You saw me cowering under the counter?<04e0>W-well! I wasn't feeling so well, you see! A bit<03e0>of stomach flu, that's it! Really! Ahahah...hrm.
The Lords hold a meeting of the Congress every<03e0>couple years at the sacred city of Elysion<07f0>you<03e0>know, at the center of the continent.<04e0>But from here, it's a long, hard journey.<04e0>If you're planning on heading to Elysion, make<03e0>sure you're stocked for a long trip.
You ever heard of Balterossa? It's a city in the<03e0>desert to the south. There you can buy weapons<03e0>forged from all sorts of odd materials.<04e0>You should see the markets at least once in<03e0>your life, kid... At least, if you've the skill to<03e0>make it there in one piece.
The Conqueror's army seems to have two main leaders...<04e0>One's an armored giant, the other's a woman;<03e0>pretty, but with a tongue as sharp as her sword.<04e0>Their positions aren't for show, either<07f0>there<03e0>isn't anyone who's been able to best them in<03e0>battle... I couldn't leave a scratch on them.<04e0>The two of them together put out this terrifying<03e0>aura, and leave behind a veritable mountain of<03e0>corpses on the battlefield...<04e0>Those two...they're not ones to trifle with.
Did you see the kind of, er, rough yama sitting<03e0>by himself downstairs?<04e0>He's one of our regulars, but unlike a lot of the<03e0>people here, he's traveled all over and knows a<03e0>lot.<04e0>If you have any questions about other parts of<03e0>the world, try screwing up your courage and<03e0>asking him, okay?<04e0>I know he looks kinda scary, but he's really a<03e0>sweet guy.
When the Conqueror attacked, lots of soldiers<03e0>gathered here in Lamberro District on their way to<03e0>the battlefield.<04e0>But only a few returned... Alive, anyway...<04e0>Oh! But our yamaan regular, he made<03e0>it back alright! Thank goodness...
You wish to know the powerful families in<03e0>Celapaleis? Hmm...<04e0>The House of Nielsen, the House of Zita... Those<03e0>two and the House of Gilles-Barre are the most<03e0>well-known, I believe.<04e0>However, since rule of Celapaleis passed to<03e0>Lord Qubine, the Gilles-Barres have fallen into<03e0>a deep decline.<04e0>Their patriarch, Count Gierven, passed away some<03e0>years ago... It's said that was the reason for the<03e0>House's fall.<04e0>Conversely, the Nielsens have risen in standing,<03e0>especially after Count Gierven's daughter was<03e0>married into the family.<04e0>Well. Even the high-born have drama, hmm?
Ooh... I've fallen, hard...<04e0>Fallen in love, of course!<04e0>With one of the Celapaleian guards... He's beautiful,<03e0>his eyes sparkle like the Umbermarici... I can't really<03e0>see under his helmet, but I just know it!<04e0>But for now, it's just a one-sided love... I'm so<03e0>worked up I feel like I could burst! *sigh*
Ahh, I'm the happiest girl in the whole world!<04e0>I asked out my crush, and he said yes!<04e0>He's one of the Celapaleian guards... His eyes sparkle<03e0>like the Umbermarici itself...but I'm the only one<03e0>allowed to peek under his helmet.<04e0>Does everyone feel this blissful when they're in<03e0>love? If I could, I'd share some of my happiness<03e0>with you...
...<04e0>Fate is a cruel mistress.<03e0>She snatched him away from me, forever...<04e0>Before he left, he asked me to forget him if the<03e0>worst happened...<04e0>Idiot...<03e0>As if I could ever forget him...<04e0>This is his sword...the only thing of his that<03e0>returned from the battlefield. Would you take it?<04e0>I was going to throw it away, but after talking to<03e0>you, I thought maybe you should have it...<03e0>Strange, isn't it...
His sword will certainly help you protect your friends.<03e0>I have to believe in that...
The gods have smiled upon me!<03e0>My beloved was dispatched to the Nest of Eagles,<03e0>but was able to return safely.<04e0>He said the army was devastated, but at the moment<03e0>all hope seemed lost, Athlum swept in and turned<03e0>the tide.<04e0>Oh! Now that I think of it, his sword... I was on<03e0>my way to sell it, but instead, let me give it to you.<04e0>He's resigned from the army, and we're to be married!<03e0>This sword has protected my fiance all this time<07f003e0>surely it will be a blessing to you as well.
Oh, has the blade been useful? It protected my beloved<03e0>for a long time. Surely it will be a blessing to you as<03e0>well.
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...<04e0>You there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah...why?<09e008e0010000000000>You're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
*snort* Playing dumb won't get you anywhere<07f0>if you're<03e0>playing at all.<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...<04e0>You're Rush Sykes, right?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup, I'm Rush!<09e008e0010000000000>You've got the wrong guy.
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.<04e0>He says he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>information-gathering, and that you should come to<03e0>the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> for details.<04e0>Got it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,<03e0>though<07f0>you're not in trouble...not with us at least.<03e0>Lord David's put out a summons for you.<04e0>Apparently he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>your information-gathering, so he'd like you to come<03e0>to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> so he can share it with you.<04e0>Don't make him wait too long, okay, kid? Or else you<03e0>might end up in trouble with us after all... Just joking!
Ohh! That valiant form...<04e0>You must be Rush Sykes, are you not?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The one and only!<09e008e0010000000000>Depends on who's asking.
Well met!<03e0>David, Marquis of Athlum requests that you come<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Athlum Castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!<03e0>I bring a message from Lord David. He requests that<03e0>you come to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Oho? But it is young Rush.<04e0>I'm afraid I have no time to chat. I am to meet a<03e0>maiden as beautiful as a blooming rose.
Do you know the subcommander of the Order<03e0>of Melphina, the fiery Ophelia?<04e0>I hear she is quite unlike the stodgy old commander<07f003e0>instead, a beauty in the flower of youth, blazing with a<03e0>passion for justice...and perhaps for other things as well.<04e0>Ahh, I should like to be the one to tame such a<03e0>tigress. I wonder, is it difficult to join this Order<03e0>of Melphina?
Ophelia, subcommander of the Order of Melphina.<03e0>Someday I shall make your acquaintance...and feel<03e0>the flames of your passion for myself.
Do you know the Lady Charlotte di Balterossa?<03e0>She is the lovely young heir to the desert<03e0>queendom.<04e0>Unlike that arrogant harpy of a mother, Charlotte<03e0>is a gentle and delicate flower...a true desert bloom.<04e0>I wonder how I may pick that flower and raise it<03e0>in a garden of my own...
The sweet princess, Charlotte di Balterossa...<03e0>Someday I will draw near enough to whisper sweet<03e0>nothings into your ear...
Do you know the goddess of Elysion,<03e0>Marion Marshall?<04e0>Not even the legendary desert queen could compare<03e0>to her greatness. It is said her beauty was enough<03e0>to set even the most stoic of hearts atremble.<04e0>If only I could lay eyes upon her, even once...<03e0>Yea, time itself plots against our romance,<03e0>yet I am certain I can find a way to surpass it...
The goddess of Elysion, Marion Marshall...<03e0>If only I could ford the streams of time to gaze<03e0>upon your beauty...
The beloved daughter of Celapaleis' storied house<03e0>of Gilles-Barre, Violet... She is noble as the rose.<04e0>Just the sight of her fighting for the glory of her<03e0>family, continuing the work her late father carried<03e0>for so long, moves my heart...<04e0>...<04e0>Shall I be frank for a moment?<04e0>I'm the third son of a poor family from Athlum.<03e0>There was no place for me in my home, so I<03e0>fled at my first opportunity.<04e0>However, on my own I realized I had little with which<03e0>to make my way. As you know well, my skill lies not<03e0>in acts of valor. My single talent is a pretty face.<04e0>Heh, no need to look so surprised. Act how I may,<03e0>I have a full understanding of the reality of my<03e0>situation. And I have taken advantage of it as well.<04e0>Thus I have made my way through the world by<03e0>pleasuring ladies and romancing maidens. Never<03e0>has one captured my heart.<04e0>Never before now...<03e0>Violet... For some reason I cannot keep her from<03e0>my thoughts. This has never happened before...<04e0>...<04e0>Forgive my going on. If nothing else, this is no<03e0>conversation for children.<04e0>Though, I had imagined Baron Nielsen to be a<03e0>base cur, while in truth he is surprisingly<03e0>broad-minded... Ah, I must let it go.<04e0>Rush, forgive my candidness. I had not intended<03e0>to speak of such odd things. Though, you are a<03e0>surprisingly good listener. It is appreciated.<04e0>Rush. Once again I pledge myself to your service.<03e0>I promise to work to the best of my abilities. As for<03e0>the extent of those abilities, I make no guarantees.
Rush Sykes! A pleasure to see you once again.<03e0>Have you need of me? If you've any troubles with the<03e0>fairer sex, then you may request my services any time.
Absolutely nothing interesting is going on lately... *sigh*
You know Baron Nielsen, right?<03e0>His wife's run off again, can you believe it?<03e0>They really must not get along!
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ah, poor Baron. He's one of our regulars, you know.
Ooh, that priggish old guy with the mustache, huh?<03e0>He always fusses at me...
I don't want to believe it, but it seems like there's<03e0>some crazy woman plotting to assassinate<03e0>Lord Qubine...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I'd heard a similar rumor from Baron Nielsen...
What? What what?<03e0>Sounds fishy to me...
So, apparently the desert princess has been sneaking<03e0>out of the castle pretty regularly to meet some<03e0>guy she's been mooning over.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I wish I could sneak away too...<03e0>Life isn't made to be spent working!
Hey hey, I'm working really hard here,<03e0>so you work hard too!
Hey! So, the desert princess has eloped<03e0>with her man!
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ahh, to drop everything and elope? Something<03e0>about it just sounds so romantic...
You just want an excuse not to come to work!
Seems relations between Balterossa and Royotia have<03e0>taken a nosedive. All the families of the soldiers are<03e0>getting worried since the armies are being mobilized...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
What about the poor princess? Wasn't she in love<03e0>with the boy from Royotia?
Guess they broke up.
So there's supposed to be something the Imperator<03e0>sealed out in the great swamp... Problem is, the seal's<03e0>broken. Could be the entrance to some other world...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Some things are just meant to be left alone...<03e0>No need to be bringing all this up now, right?
Monsters are popping out of it!
There's a Forest Maiden who's so attuned to<03e0>the Knight she's bound to, she can like, see through<03e0>his eyes or hear things he's heard.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I'm bound to you, so let's go take a vacation!<03e0>Hmm? You really want to go now, yes?
No! Go by yourself!
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina<03e0>are mobilizing... Seems something's happened to<03e0>the Last Leaf in Crookfen.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Whatever. If monsters want it so bad,<03e0>let them have it.
Irresponsible, much?
It's almost time for Kosmosfest! But apparently<03e0>the Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to Nagapur yet.<03e0>Seems like maybe she's in trouble...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Why don't they just get a substitute maiden?
Do they have one?
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started<03e0>the Kosmosfest alright. Usually nothing much happens,<03e0>but this time it was interrupted by monsters.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Why not just let the monsters join in?
If it's a fighting festival, sure!
Some old-fashioned-looking woman is looking to hire<03e0>bodyguards, I hear. She's supposed to be hanging<03e0>out at the pub near the canal.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Hmm. There's a canal here in Celapaleis, but<03e0>something makes me think this girl is in some<03e0>other town.
Wait, what? We have a canal?
Hey, are you into antiques?<03e0>Apparently a lot of the treasures of the Old<03e0>Kingdoms are turning up on the black market.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ah, you picked up some things from Undelwalt a while<03e0>back, didn't you... So, were those from the black market?
Ack! They were from the pub!
Some guy is looking for these three stones that're<03e0>really important to the desert.<03e0>Historically significant, or something.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ah, maybe I can help out.<03e0>I've tossed around plenty of rocks.
Not the ones here, special ones!
Some guy into ancient magick is looking for people to<03e0>help out with his research. Seems he's on the verge<03e0>of making some huge discovery.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Sounds boring. I'll pass.
Okay!
Apparently some monster sealed by the Imperator<03e0>has appeared. It's really got people spooked, saying<03e0>it's the end of the world, and all.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Well...c'est la vie.
That's so harsh...
Some amnesiac is wandering around the cities in<03e0>the desert, looking for something that could<03e0>regain his memory.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
He should concentrate on making new memories,<03e0>not finding old ones.
Oh! That's surprisingly moving...
Recently people've been seeing this infamous bandit<03e0>around Athlum. Apparently he's waiting around for<03e0>someone but no one's brave enough to ask who.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
An infamous bandit? ...It couldn't be Loki, could it?<03e0>Goodness, what has Athlum come to?
Loki? Never heard of him.
There's a goddess statue in the Robelia Ruins that'll<03e0>let you find someone, no matter how far away they are.<03e0>Some kid looking for his sister is interested in it...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Say you've a statue like that while fighting through<03e0>a love triangle...<03e0>What happens then?
Go halfsies?
Some weird...thing's been lurking around Celapaleis,<03e0>giving people the willies.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ah<07f0>I've seen it! Ugh, it was terrible...
It was cute!
There's a murderer on the loose in the capital!
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I hope they catch him as soon as possible...
Me too. Ooh, scary...
There's some massive yama looking for stuff...<03e0>But he's kinda out there so people've been trying to<03e0>keep out of his way.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
It's best not to associate with people like that.
Yeah, I guess...<03e0>I kinda feel bad for him though!
Some white qsiti's been looking for a magickal book.<03e0>People seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's<03e0>been able to place him.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Magick...that's that ancient, strange power, right?<03e0>It can't be learnt without a lot of study.
I want ancient powers! But I don't want to study...
There're these twins that've turned up as mercenaries<03e0>lately...good ones, too. The one girl is supposed to be<03e0>a real cool customer<07f0>both in looks, and in attitude.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ahh, I wish I were a twin. Whenever I felt like ditching<03e0>work, I could switch off with her.
You realize that when you're switching off, you don't<03e0>get paid, right?
Some guy out in the Great Sand Sea's been looking for<03e0>challengers for some sort of game<07f0>but he seems<03e0>the type not to deal with regular people.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Well then, let's not deal with him, either.
Works for me!
Some old warrior's crossed the Great Sand Sea,<03e0>looking for a special sword.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
No one can cross the Great Sand Sea alone.
Huh? But what about this guy?
The guards of Ghor have all sworn to follow their ruler<03e0>for as long as they live.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Men are fond of that sort of thing.
Yeah... It's pretty cool, don't you think?
The Honeywell family is known as a super-dedicated<03e0>family. Some say that with their support you can<03e0>do anything.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Like General Emma, right? I met her once when I was<03e0>a child. She was beautiful.
She's pretty striking now!<03e0>But yeah, I wonder what she looked like when<03e0>she was young.
Apparently Athlum's General Torgal is supposed to<03e0>have some things in his past that're coming back to<03e0>haunt him. Stuff's supposed to be going on in Royotia...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Torgal is that sovani, yes?<03e0>For a sovani to serve a mitra, something significant<03e0>must have happened in his past...
Huh... Do you think he owes money?
It's about time for the Tournament of Heroes to start<03e0>up again. It's pretty well-known among the types with<03e0>fighting spirit.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ooh, those sorts of things are not for me.
But I bet I'd be okay, right?
Apparently there's some mystic academy that's been<03e0>spitting out skilled magi for years.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Come to think of it, how's your homework<03e0>coming along?
It's...going? Sort of? Not really?
Athlum's been going through some tough times, and<03e0>people are worried about the new matriarch of<03e0>the Honeywell clan because she's so young.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I think she'll be fine.<03e0>She's a carbon copy of General Emma.
Huh, so the young General Emma looked just<03e0>like General Emmy!
Recently there's been gossip about Lord David's<03e0>love interests...or lack thereof.<03e0>He's never been connected with anybody.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Really? I could swear there was that one person<03e0>a while back...
What? What? Really?<03e0>If you know something, you've gotta dish!
The old head of the Academy's been seen in pubs<03e0>across the continent lately. I guess it stands to reason<03e0>she'd want to drown her sorrows after what happened.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Really, what people should be asking is why she was<03e0>in charge of the Academy in the first place...
The whole thing's pretty fishy.
Dr. Sykes has been seen going in and out of Athlum<03e0>Castle lately. Maybe there's been some new discovery!
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I heard that their son was staying at Athlum Castle.
Oh, guess he volunteered for the army, huh.
Some unidentified flying object's been spotted<03e0>swooping around Wyrmskeep.<03e0>It's totally been freaking everyone out...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
It's...not going to come around here, is it?
If it does, let's catch it!
Some hot-blooded female warrior is trying to hunt<03e0>down that group causing trouble in Crookfen.<03e0>But it's against her boss's wishes...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Hunt them down...but for whose benefit?
Yeah...<03e0>Sounds like she's doing it for herself more than<03e0>anything...
Some monster army's appeared in the Great Sand Sea.<03e0>They're so powerful that everyone in Balterossa<03e0>is totally in despair...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Goodness! What could possibly be going on?
Is the desert really gonna be okay?
According to ancient historians, there's something<03e0>dangerous enough to destroy entire cities sealed<03e0>within the volcano...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
And this has been kept secret all this time?<03e0>Why not tell everyone?
I guess they were hoping it'd stay sealed so it<03e0>wouldn't matter.
No one knows anything about the stuff going on inside<03e0>the volcano, nor does anyone know how to find out...<03e0>But, the Marquis of Royotia might have some ideas...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Certainly the Marquis will have some sort of plan.
Wonder what it is? Probably "kill it with fire"!
You know there's a town without anyone running it?<03e0>The old ruler's sons are fighting over the seat of power.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Obviously they should just both rule.
If not, I'll do it!
When you're out in the desert, you can hear this sad,<03e0>lonely voice crying from beneath the Great Sand Sea.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Hey! You know I don't like those sorts of stories...
But it's interesting, don't you think?
A long time ago, there used to be a famed hero that<03e0>lived in the Great Sand Sea.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Right, right.<03e0>We know that the majority of what you say is<03e0>completely made up.
It is not!
So I was walking through town and heard this guy all<03e0>"you gotta believe me! If you look at the pillars in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea, then...g-g-gra<07f0>!"
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Hey! Enough with all that, already!
But it's funnn!
Some crackpot old scientist has been wandering<03e0>around Melphina. If you go over there, you probably<03e0>should stay away, he's giving people strange looks.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
What sorts of things could he want people for?
To experiment on them, I guess...
The cafe out in Baaluk's supposedly infested with<03e0>bugs...they followed the guy all the way from the desert.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
And they still get customers?
They're totally gonna lose their restaurant license!
Nagapur's been increasingly unsafe. Just recently<03e0>another bunch of kids have gone missing...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Kidnappings... Something like that was going on<03e0>in Athlum recently, wasn't it...
Oh yeah, General Blocter busted the group, right?<03e0>Wonder if these are the same guys?
Adventurers have gotten into trading the different<03e0>treasures they find on their trips. Apparently,<03e0>Royotia's the main hub for the fad.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I'd never heard of that... Where is all this going on?
If they're using trade routes, probably mainly between<03e0>Balterossa and Royotia, I'd say.
Royotian merchants are getting frustrated with<03e0>Balterossa...they control all of their trade goods.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Definitely! Royotian things only get here after<03e0>passing through Balterossa and Elysion, so they're<03e0>always incredibly expensive!
It'd be a lot easier if they came straight here,<03e0>you know?
Some yamaan mercenary's out looking for a partner.<03e0>Could be a good way to make a few G.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
A mercenary hiring other mercenaries?
That's a pretty conservative yama, huh.
Some guy with a hot-and-cold personality's just<03e0>shown up in Celapaleis. He'll seem really sweet and<03e0>then suddenly turn rough at the drop of a hat.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
That's one of our customers, yes?
Yeah... He looked really sad, too...
There's some crazy qsiti going to crowded places and<03e0>standing in the way, and then picking fights with<03e0>people who run into him. What an annoyance...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
People like that tend to feel hurt more easily than<03e0>others...
Really? I figured they were just annoying.
So, a guy was telling me about this mysterious<03e0>woman he saw. He said she looked like she had<03e0>the whole world on her shoulders...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ahh, I want some men to hit on me, too...
Ehh? That kind of guy is absolutely the worst!
You've probably seen them if you've gone to<03e0>Crookfen, but Bloody Alice has been gathering.<03e0>Looks like something big's going on...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ooh, they're the ones stealing things across<03e0>the continent, right?<03e0>Someone needs to hurry up and catch them already!
Definitely!
Seems the Jhana have been popping up in the Great<03e0>Sand Sea. You wouldn't think they'd have forgotten<03e0>being blasted by the Gae Bolg already...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I've heard the Silver Falcons were already moving to<03e0>drive them back.
Yup! They're helpful for sure!
Recently the Silver Falcons took out a pack of Jhana.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Thank goodness! The Silver Falcons seem to be<03e0>the only ones we can depend on these days...
Someday, I want to join!
The Silver Falcons have been going after what's left<03e0>of the Conqueror's army.<03e0>Who knows what those guys could be up to...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Conqueror? What is he?
He's really strong, for one!
Some gloomy-looking guy's been hanging around<03e0>the pub in Elysion recently...bumming everyone out.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
All sorts of people gather in Elysion...seems like<03e0>it could be a little alarming.
Plenty of underground stuff, if you know what I mean!

Then, you are Rush Sykes, are you?<03e0>I've heard a lot about you.<04e0>Feel free to amply prepare yourself for your<03e0>coming battles here in Celapaleis.
The loss of General Honeywell and the Valeria<03e0>Heart are both very regrettable... I offer my<03e0>deepest condolences.<04e0>Yet, had you not gone to the Nest of Eagles, all<03e0>of Celapaleis would have been in grave danger.<04e0>I cannot begin to describe my appreciation for<03e0>what you've done.
I've not been feeling well of late...<04e0>It must be due to the debacle with Nagapur. I<03e0>suppose cleaning up that mess was more tiring<03e0>than I thought... Either way, it's nothing to worry about.
Ahh... For me to be in such a state... Keep this a<03e0>secret from Ghor, would you? I'm certain the old<03e0>bat would never let me hear the end of it.
So Hermeien was behind the escalation of<03e0>the Remnants' powers...<04e0>I didn't even dream it could be him.<03e0>I still have so much to learn...<03e0>Ghor will never let me live this down, will he?
The future of Athlum lies in your hands.<04e0>The God Emperor is not a man to be trifled with.<03e0>Do not let down your guard before him.
There are two paths to take.<04e0>One path allows you to be the creators of a new world.<03e0>The other brands you as traitors to the God Emperor<03e0>as you are slain mercilessly by his followers.<04e0>Show me what you have chosen.
Watch your tongue, boy!<03e0>You stand before Lord Qubine!
To think he suffers so...<03e0>Poor, valiant Lord Qubine!
To think, he suffers so...<03e0>Poor, valiant Lord Qubine!<04e0>Someone, anyone<07f003e0>Can no one bring a healer that might help?
The Duke still hasn't fully recovered.<03e0>Say what you came to say and be off!
Though Athlum has been granted independence, that<03e0>does not mean you can milk the Duke for more<03e0>favors.<04e0>Stand on your own two feet!
If word gets out you are here with the Duke, his Lord<03e0>may be branded a conspirator!<03e0>If you're done with your business, please leave!

Lady Emma reports that your talisman holds a<03e0>mysterious power.
Yeah, it does.<03e0>What? You think she's lying?
Lady Emma is an honest person.<03e0>I have no reason to doubt her.<04e0>So this power...<03e0>Can it be used outside of battles?
What do you mean?
Can you show me its power now?
Hmm, I dunno.<04e0>I can try, though.
Wh-what just happened!?
I see...<03e0>It holds the power to manipulate time.<04e0>Proper application of such a power would give a clear<03e0>advantage when battling monsters, as well as allow<03e0>you to engage many foes in battle at once.<04e0>However, it is almost certain that such a power cannot<03e0>be applied indefinitely.

Are you lost, my boy?<03e0>Not to worry<07f0>that happens all of the time.<04e0>Up above is the <1be0ffbe34ff>Remnant Elysion<1ce0>. Beneath that<03e0>lies the ivory structure of the assembly hall, and<03e0>numerous esteemed temples.<04e0>The city is a sanctuary for many.<04e0>But don't let an old man like me bore you with his<03e0>stories.

See the cloud spiraling towards the heavens?<03e0>The Sacred Lands rest up there.<04e0>It used to be that when someone was talking about<03e0>"Elysion," that's what they meant. Nowadays the name<03e0>refers to this town as well.<04e0>I know I'm just a security guard, but someday I hope to<03e0>go up there!
Hey, did you see that!?<04e0>A really bright light just flashed across the sky from the<03e0>Ark up towards the Sacred Lands!<04e0>If only I'd been in the Ark... I could've gone up to the<03e0>Sacred Lands, I bet...
I know who that was<07f0>the Conqueror and his<03e0>army.<04e0>I figured they'd be a bunch of disorganized thugs, but<03e0>they were pretty impressive-looking.<04e0>And that woman soldier, the one who gave that speech?<03e0>What a looker! I wish she was my commanding officer...

I saw it with my own two eyes!<03e0>A flash of light shot straight from the Ark<03e0>up to the heavens!<04e0>I wonder what that was. All I know is that it was<03e0>much brighter than the usual light the Ark emits<03e0>when in use.
So that's the infamous Conqueror.<03e0>I hear he's bad news, causing trouble<03e0>everywhere he goes.<04e0>What an evil glare he has!<03e0>I hope he leaves our town peacefully...and soon!
Everyone in this part of the holy city is in<03e0>such low spirits with the death of Chairman<03e0>Hermeien and the downfall of the Academy.<04e0>It seems the old folks in the temple district<03e0>have much more zest nowadays.

Hey, Rushie!<04e0>I'm having a fab time in town!<03e0>This place is like heaven!
Rushie, do you believe in witches?<04e0>They're women with the ability to, like,<03e0>use special powers, like magick.<04e0>...<04e0>You have no idea what magick is, do you...?<03e0>Then I guess you wouldn't know anything<03e0>about the Witch's Signet.<04e0>Sigh!<03e0>You need to, like, read more books<03e0>or something. Useless!
Rushie, you need to, like, read more<03e0>books or something. Useless!
You know how I was talking about witches<03e0>before? Maybe I can try to, like, explain<03e0>it a little. I'll tell you what my grandma told me.<04e0>So a really, really long time ago, there was<03e0>this thing called magick. It was nothing like<03e0>the spells we use where you need an object.<04e0>With magick, you can even rip through dimensions<03e0>and stuff, or summon monsters!<03e0>Scientists and people still talk about it today!<04e0>So a witch is a female who can like,<03e0>totally use magick!<04e0>I'm supposed to be, like, a descendant or<03e0>something of a clan that has these powers.<04e0>You don't know anything, do you?<03e0>I'm so exhausted!<03e0>I'll tell you the rest later.
I'm supposed to be, like, a descendant or<03e0>something of a clan of witches!
Anyway, so to continue my story...<04e0>When you're part of a family with these<03e0>kinda powers, they make you like, go<03e0>out and train when you're young.<04e0>So that's what I'm doing right now.<03e0>I need to, like, get this thing called the Witch's<03e0>Signet. It's...somewhere in this world.<04e0>I'm so totally over this training, so I want<03e0>to find it ASAP and be done with it!<03e0>So, Rushie, will you help me find this thingy?
I'm so totally over this training!<03e0>I want to find the signet ASAP and be done<03e0>with it all!
Thanks a million for helping me find<03e0>the Witch's Signet, Rushie!<04e0>Okay, so I made a decision.<03e0>I'm going to become a witch!<04e0>According to the signet, the job of, like, a true<03e0>witch is to discover the world's truths!<04e0>I figure I can travel the world to learn more<03e0>about magick and stuff. And maybe I can<03e0>become a real witch!<04e0>I'm gonna wait to tell Grandma I found<03e0>the signet. I'm gonna become a kickass<03e0>witch and surprise her one day!<04e0>So Rushie, I'll be seeing a lot of you.<03e0>Lucky you!

The embassy big-shots are in a flurry.<04e0>Why, you ask?<04e0>Did you miss that flash of light?<03e0>I think something snuck into<03e0>the Sacred Lands!

The shop owners are down in the dumps.<04e0>Why, you ask?<04e0>The shops in this market used to be<03e0>funded by the Congress.<04e0>But now that Chairman Ghor is in charge,<03e0>the administrative types from Hermeien's<03e0>reign are gone.<04e0>Oh, well... I guess it wasn't fair that<03e0>our town was getting special treatment<03e0>in the first place.
Are you ready?<06e0000008e0000000000000>'Course!<09e008e0010000000300>Um, not just yet.
Alright. Hurry it up.<03e0>Come back to me when you're ready.
Alright. Let us leave.<04e0>Be on your toes<07f0>we're going to<03e0>encounter a lot of monsters.
Oh, it's you.<04e0>Did you want something?
I left my hometown and its dumb, outdated<03e0>traditions to come to the great city of Elysion.<04e0>With my incredible and awe-inspiring skills, I can<03e0>work as a mercenary and save up a bunch of cash<03e0>in no time!
I left my hometown and its outdated traditions<03e0>to come to the great city of Elysion.
The vow made between a maiden and a knight standing<03e0>in front of the holy chalice is a power strong enough<03e0>to protect the country.<04e0>...Or at least that's what the saps back home believe.<03e0>But not me, no way!<04e0>A true man can't buy into that kind of bullshit.<03e0>That's right<07f0>bullshit!
The vow made between two people can<03e0>be strong enough to protect a country!?<03e0>What a load of bull!
The thing is... I used to have this childhood friend.<03e0>She was a sickly little crybaby, but with a real heart of<03e0>gold. Ever since I was a kid I'd looked out for her.<04e0>And once I was old enough, we promised to make<03e0>our vow in front of the holy chalice<07f0>the vow<03e0>between a maiden and a knight.<04e0>But...okay. So, yeah, I know I'm not the classiest guy<03e0>around. And maybe I've made a few mistakes, acted<03e0>out a couple times<07f0>for good reasons, I might add!<04e0>Either way, to err is qsiti, to forgive divine, right?<03e0>Well, guess that saying's just pretty talk, 'cause<03e0>I couldn't get accepted as a knight.<04e0>I kept trying, but her illness just kept getting<03e0>worse. She died before we could make our vow.<04e0>She left this world, disappointed in me, all<03e0>because of that stupid tradition.<03e0>So I smashed the holy chalice!
I was supposed to make a vow with<03e0>a friend but she died, disappointed in me.<04e0>If there hadn't been that stupid tradition, then...<03e0>Dammit!
So... Deep down, I know that no matter how old and<03e0>stupid they may be, blaming tradition for everything<03e0>isn't right.<04e0>It was my own fault that I couldn't become a knight<03e0>before she died. I just didn't want to face the truth,<03e0>so I took it out on something else.<04e0>It just hurts so much to think of how I let her<03e0>down...<04e0>But I've gotta face my demons. I've gotta start<03e0>living a life that I can be proud of<07f0>that she would<03e0>be proud of.<04e0>Thanks for listening, Rush.<03e0>I can see clearly now.<03e0>I can't dwell on the past anymore.<04e0>I owe you one.
Rush, I'm not going to dwell on the past<03e0>anymore. I'm going to live a life that<03e0>she and I can be proud of. Thanks again!

Elysion is under the rule of the Congress,<03e0>an organization consisting of the heads<03e0>of each state.<04e0>This is why a research establishment<03e0>like the Academy is here in this city.

This is the highest tier of Elysion.<04e0>The Academy is up these stairs and<03e0>across the main street.<04e0>The assembly hall is at the end of the street,<03e0>but civilians aren't allowed entry.<04e0>The stairs next to the assembly hall lead to<03e0>the Ark.

I came all the way from Nagapur<03e0>to take in the sights.<04e0>I rushed home when I heard about<03e0>the Gwayn, but...<04e0>My neighborhood was nothing but rubble.<03e0>I hope the souls of those who perished<03e0>made it to the Sacred Lands.<04e0>Nothing would make me happier...
Elysion is referred to as the capital of<03e0>the world, not because of its size, but<03e0>because it's home to the Academy.<04e0>Uncovering the truth about Remnants means<03e0>uncovering the biggest truth ever to exist.
I just saw a bright light shoot straight from<03e0>the Ark to the Sacred Lands.<04e0>That couldn't have been the work of the Academy.<03e0>Was it possible that someone snuck in to abuse<03e0>the Ark?<04e0>But the Ark is already bound...<03e0>This doesn't make any sense.

Rumor has it that Chairman Hermeien was<03e0>using his powers to secretly research a way<03e0>to turn Remnants into weapons.<04e0>When that fell through, people began<03e0>to leave the Academy.<04e0>One of the reasons may have been the passing<03e0>of the late Chairman, but the biggest reason<03e0>was due to the Gwayn's actions.<04e0>After the destruction it caused, everyone<03e0>must have realized that Remnants<03e0>can't be truly controlled by anyone.

Lord David, please allow me to escort you<03e0>to the assembly hall.
I understand.<03e0>Please come to me when you are ready.
Hello, Rush!<04e0>Is everything well?
I don't know why, but I feel comfortable<03e0>here. I guess there are a lot of good<03e0>memories.<04e0>I know it must sound weird to you,<03e0>since they fired me from the Academy.
I feel comfortable here.<03e0>I have some good memories at the Academy.
Even though I've left the Academy,<03e0>I still wonder about Remnants and<03e0>what they really are.<04e0>If we can discover their true powers,<03e0>we might be able to use them to stop<03e0>the ongoing war in this world.
If we can discover the true powers of<03e0>Remnants, we might be able to use them<03e0>to stop the ongoing war!
Remnants provide us with knowledge<03e0>and enhance our lives in many ways.<03e0>They are the world's greatest treasure.<04e0>But lately, I've been beginning to think<03e0>that we were never meant to use or<03e0>benefit from their powers.<04e0>The sad truth is that the world has<03e0>become reliant on Remnants, which<03e0>seem to have a part in everyone's lives.<04e0>We've spent centuries trying to understand<03e0>what makes them tick, but we've gained very<03e0>little knowledge.<04e0>Rush, maybe we were wrong to have<03e0>taken control over these divine objects.
Maybe we weren't meant to benefit<03e0>from the powers of Remnants.<03e0>If that's the case...
Rush, I've thought about some things.<04e0>I haven't been able to find answers to all<03e0>of my questions, but I did figure out something.<04e0>Remnants reflect our morality.<03e0>If we make poor choices, their powers<03e0>reflect that.<04e0>I want to find a way we can coexist<07f003e0>a way for us and Remnants to be happy.<04e0>I want to travel the world and discover<03e0>more of what's out there.<03e0>I may find the answers I need.<04e0>I hope I can find what I'm looking for<03e0>while helping you out with your journey.
Rush, I want to find a way for us to<03e0>coexist peacefully with Remnants.<03e0>I hope we can work together to find answers.

Welcome to the Academy.<03e0>I am Haruko, the director.
You're Rush Sykes?<03e0>I'm so sorry I can't let you<03e0>see your parents...<04e0>I'm Haruko, director of the Academy.
Don't tell anyone I told you...<04e0>Doctors John and Marina Sykes are off in the <1be0ffbe34ff>Sacred<03e0>Lands<1ce0> for a routine evaluation.
It will be a while before anyone can get in touch with<03e0>them, because you have to use the <1be0ffbe34ff>Remnant Ark<1ce0> to get<03e0>up there.<04e0>Unfortunately, once the Ark is used, you need to wait<03e0>several months before you can use it again.
Your parents are in the Sacred Lands for a routine<03e0>evaluation.<04e0>They can't be reached for a while.
I'm sorry I can't let you see your parents...
Welcome to the Academy.
Welcome to the Academy.<03e0>How may I help you?
Ummm...<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm here to see Doctor Sykes.<09e008e0010000000000>Never mind.
I'm sorry, but the doctors are in the middle of some<03e0>extensive research and cannot be disturbed at this time.
The Academy strives to make the world a better place<03e0>by spreading the fruit of our labor to every corner of<03e0>the world.<04e0>We are never to inject our personal feelings into any<03e0>matters here.
The laboratory is off-limits to non-Academy members.
I worked with John on a previous project.<04e0>He's very down-to-earth and kind, especially<03e0>considering that he's one of the best scientists working<03e0>at the Academy.<04e0>He's a family man, too. He has a picture of his family<03e0>on his desk that he's always staring at.
What? The Ark was activated?<03e0>That's impossible.<04e0>It's bound to a member of the Academy.<04e0>Meaning, it can only be activated by a member of the<03e0>research team that was hand-picked by the Academy.<04e0>Your eyes are just playing tricks on you.
Since the new Congress came into office, all the<03e0>scientists closest to Duke Hermeien have left the<03e0>Academy.<04e0>Thanks to all this change, I have less say and less pay.<04e0>But ehh, I guess I'll stay and continue my research.
You're looking for a Remnant that takes you<03e0>to the Sacred Lands?<04e0>I've heard stories of another Ark-like Remnant<03e0>existing outside of Elysion.
What happens if a town loses its Remnant, you ask?<04e0>As far as I know, the land returns to its normal state.<03e0>Harsh winds dry out the earth and all of the vegetation<03e0>just withers away.<04e0>Sometimes volcanoes erupt and burn down entire towns.<03e0>Or rivers overflow and flood the lands.<04e0>But not all bad things will happen to every town.<03e0>After all, there are towns that don't have Remnants.<04e0>Like Eulam Island. I hear it's not supposed to be that bad<03e0>of a place to live, even though it doesn't have a Remnant.<04e0>Say, why the question?
I admire both of the Sykes. They're the most brilliant<03e0>scientists working for the Academy.<04e0>But they win my respect because they're both opposed<03e0>to the weaponization of Remnants.<04e0>I hope I get to work with them someday!
...The Ark was activated!?<03e0>How could that be?<04e0>Once a Remnant's been bound, it can't be activated<03e0>by anyone else until the bind is broken.<04e0>We all learned that in Remnants 101.<04e0>Does that mean that...what we've been taught is wrong?
After Lord Hermeien passed, the Academy underwent<03e0>some changes. Even Director Haruko was fired.<04e0>She was so passionate and involved in the research.<03e0>She was a great director...<04e0>Then, a bunch of other people picked up and left of<03e0>their own free will.<04e0>I plan to stay, though.<04e0>I need to find a way to prevent what happened in<03e0>Nagapur from happening again.
The Hermeiens were placed in charge of all Remmants<03e0>once used by the Imperator.<04e0>The late Chairman Hermeien is the only soul I can<03e0>think of that would have had knowledge of what you<03e0>are looking for.
The previous director was an old fogey appointed way<03e0>back by the previous Congress Chairman.<04e0>He was very pushy and overbearing, always tried to<03e0>keep things to himself. Not many of us liked him.<04e0>There were always rumors flying around about him<03e0>causing problems behind the scenes... Everyone thinks<03e0>this latest personnel shuffle was meant to shut those up.
Everyone around town is talking about how the Ark<03e0>was activated.<04e0>The legendary Marion Marshall is the only one I've<03e0>ever heard of who can overwrite bindings of Remnants.<04e0>Perhaps she's come back to us...
The late Duke Hermeien was doing unmentionable things<03e0>using the Academy as a cover.<04e0>The weaponization and duplication of Remnants...<04e0>It saddens me to think that my fellow scientists were<03e0>such unethical people.<04e0>I'll stay and find a way, though<07f0>a way for us to<03e0>use Remnants for the good of the world.
The Ark was discovered by the Imperator.<04e0>Perhaps there are similar Remnants in the lands<03e0>he has visited?
...

Straight ahead is the Remnant Ark.<04e0>The Academy has the ability to send a<03e0>select few to the Sacred Lands<03e0>several times a year.<04e0>The Remnant that Marion Marshall<03e0>bound to herself is the Sacred Lands,<03e0>the mass of rock above.<04e0>The Sacred Lands is where our souls<03e0>go to rest when we pass away<07f003e0>it is even referred to as a heaven.
Wh-what happened?<03e0>Wh-where am I...?<04e0>I was... I was talking about the Sacred Lands...<03e0>...and I don't know what happened<03e0>after that...<04e0>Do you know what just happened here!?
This area has become off-limits to civilians<03e0>following the incident at Nagapur.<03e0>What a shame...
That light... So celestial...<04e0>Seeing that was worth my trek here.<03e0>I can cross this off of my list of things<03e0>to do before I die.
That large man clothed in red touched<03e0>the Ark right before that light shot<03e0>up to the heavens.<04e0>Who was he?<03e0>A reaper, perhaps?
So this is the Ark.<03e0>I thought it would look more like<03e0>something you ride.<04e0>How does this work exactly?
A bright light shot out of the Ark<03e0>a second ago. I think it means that<03e0>man bound the Ark to himself.<04e0>I wonder how he did it.<03e0>This Remnant is huge!
This area is off-limits.

Welcome to the Heavenly Terrace.<03e0>What would you like to know about?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The neighboring cities<09e008e0010000000000>The Academy<09e008e0020000000000>You
Elysion's central location makes it simple to travel to<03e0>many places from here. As for places worth visiting...<03e0>Hmm, let's see.<04e0>Balterossa, a large trade city to the southwest, has<03e0>a huge population and a great selection of goods.<04e0>Ooh, and there's Royotia, a mining town south past the<03e0>desert. The area is famous for quality ore.<04e0>Let's see... What other places are out there?<03e0>You should go see for yourself!
The Academy is a Remnant research facility found near<03e0>the assembly hall.<04e0>The Academy is heavily backed by the Congress.<03e0>Chairman Hermeien's obsession with Remnants borders<03e0>on unnatural.<04e0>He invests a lot of money to keep the Academy afloat.
Come back in ten years, cutie, when you've grown into<03e0>a real man<07f0>and I'll tell you anything you want to<03e0>know then. Anything. *wink*
Now that you've heard all about the other towns, it might<03e0>be a good time to go and see them with your own eyes.
Oh, I almost forgot!<04e0>Far to the southeast of Elysion is Melphina,<03e0>the town of scholars. I hear it's a beautiful<03e0>town surrounded by nature.<04e0>If only I could get a day off. I'd love to go<03e0>to Melphina and see for myself.
The Academy is the building across from the assembly<03e0>hall. With support from the Congress, they research<03e0>Remnants.<04e0>Under Duke Hermeien, there was some illegal<03e0>experimentation going on there, but all that's stopped<03e0>since the Duke of Ghor became Congress chairman.<04e0>It's become a decent organization again.
You want directions to other towns?<03e0>Listen carefully, sonny.<04e0>The <1be0ffbe34ff>Southwestern Road<1ce0> to the desert is used as a trade<03e0>route, but any merchant traveling that road takes plenty<03e0>of protection<07f0>and with good reason.<04e0>That place is crawling with monsters!<04e0>If you value your life, you won't take that road. Capice?
The army that was making a scene<03e0>on Tula Street... What was their business?<03e0>That lady was a looker, though, huh?<04e0>But where in the world is Veyriel?<03e0>I know my geography and I've never heard<03e0>of the town!
There are strongholds around Elysion that were built to<03e0>protect this city from invaders. Of course, they haven't<03e0>been used for hundreds of years.<04e0>But lately...there have been rumors of suspicious folks<03e0>hanging around them.<04e0>I don't know who's up to what, but it can't be good!
There are plenty of goodies to buy in Elysion, but I really<03e0>recommend the Blessed Buns.<04e0>They're soft and feathery on the outside, like clouds,<03e0>with a creamy filling, like the Remnant Elysion floating<03e0>within them.<04e0>One bite will take you to heaven<07f0>or the Sacred Lands.<04e0>Getting hungry?<03e0>They're sold in Hendler if you want to go home with<03e0>a pack or ten!
Hey, listen up.<04e0>I heard rumors of people hanging around the strongholds<03e0>at night and I decided to check it out for myself.<04e0>That's when I saw Lord Hermeien, who supposedly died<03e0>in the war!<04e0>I've told a few people but no one believes me.<03e0>But I know what I saw!
You've been thinking about that too, eh?<03e0>...Don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking<03e0>about! The barkeep!<04e0>The white lab coat she used to wear...<03e0>The blond hair that shines like the sun...<03e0>Fiery almond-shaped eyes full of life...<04e0>You're thinking of going after her, aren't you!? Well,<03e0>you should give up now. You know why?<04e0>If the research that my brother's doing in Melphina is<03e0>successful, she'll fall head over heels in love with me!<03e0>Hahaha!
You thought so, too, did you?<04e0>That army that came around talking about<03e0>dreams and such... It all has to be a ruse by<03e0>some lowly lord to get invited to the Congress.<04e0>That big guy in the armor must have been<03e0>the Conqueror, but he didn't emanate<03e0>a single ounce of intelligence or leadership!<04e0>This all has to be one big joke...
You've been thinking about that too, eh?<03e0>...Don't look at me like you don't know<03e0>what I'm talking about! The strongholds!<04e0>Rumor has it that shady-types have been seen using<03e0>them lately. Me, I think it's a bunch of ex-Academy<03e0>members doing some sort of "private" research.<04e0>Me and my brother used to do all kinds of experiments<03e0>when we were young... Hahaha!
The new Academy director, Ms. Haruko, is very skilled as<03e0>a scientist, but I'm not sure she has the management<03e0>skills to run the whole Academy.<04e0>She was probably put in that position temporarily, and<03e0>will soon be replaced by someone else<07f0>perhaps<03e0>John Sykes.
Ahh, the Academy's done for.<04e0>Once the Congress found out Hermeien had a group<03e0>doing underground Remnant research, not only did they<03e0>disband it, but they cut funds for the rest of us as well.<04e0>You can guess how well that went over... The only<03e0>scientists left are the ones who are really passionate<03e0>about what they do.<04e0>I think I'm on my way out, too. I guess I'll go back home<03e0>and marry the man my parents picked out after all.
I hear there's some unknown army making use of the<03e0>abandoned strongholds near Elysion.<04e0>They're not using just one, but several of them.<04e0>It...couldn't be the Conqueror's army, could it?<03e0>I was so certain they'd all perished in Nagapur...<04e0>Oh, I don't even want to entertain the thought!
Hehe, my days are so lax.
Then you're fired.
Hehe, my days are so busy.
You know Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis? Seems his<03e0>wife's disappeared. ...'Course, those two are famous<03e0>for not getting along, so it's nothing new.
Interesting, huh?
Why does he put up with that?<03e0>That is NOT acceptable behavior.
I heard someone's plotting to assassinate<03e0>Duke Qubine... Rumor has it a suspicious-<03e0>looking woman was spotted lurking about.
Interesting, huh?
And the idiots didn't bring her in for questioning?
So, apparently the desert princess has been<03e0>sneaking out of the castle pretty regularly to<03e0>meet some guy she's been mooning over.
Interesting, huh?
Children need to get into trouble and<03e0>receive punishment. Brats need a taste of<03e0>the real world!
...Speaking from experience, are you?
I heard the desert princess eloped with<03e0>her new man.
Interesting, huh?
Only fools elope! Stupid kids.<03e0>...<03e0>Why can't I find love...?
Hehe!
The conflict between Balterossa and<03e0>Royotia is getting worse by the day.<03e0>Everyone thinks there's a war coming.
Interesting, huh?
If people know it's coming, why don't<03e0>they do something to try to stop it<03e0>from happening? Lazy bastards...
...Easier said than done.
Rumor has it that in a certain moor,<03e0>the Imperator used his powers to<03e0>seal the entranceway to another realm.
Interesting, huh?
What a useless bastard. Why didn't<03e0>he just destroy it to save us grief?
...I think he would have, if that had<03e0>been an option.
If a Forest Maiden vows eternity with<03e0>a Melphinian knight, she gains the power to<03e0>see and hear whatever her partner does.
Interesting, huh?
That has got to be annoying!<03e0>Everyone needs their alone time.<03e0>Ugh, I could never do that.
...Don't worry<07f0>no one will ever ask you to.
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina<03e0>are getting ready for something big. I think something's<03e0>happened to the Last Leaf in Crookfen.
Interesting, huh?
See? I was right! The Imperator IS<03e0>a useless bastard! This wouldn't have<03e0>happened if he had destroyed the damn thing!
...Why don't you go back in time<03e0>a thousand years and tell him?
It's almost time for Kosmosfest, huh? But apparently<03e0>the Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to Nagapur yet.<03e0>Maybe she got mixed up in something.
Interesting, huh?
She's probably just taking her sweet<03e0>time getting ready.<03e0>Women are so vain!
...You're not?
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started<03e0>the festival alright. Usually it's a pretty quiet event<03e0>until the monsters show up.
Interesting, huh?
It's a festival! Lighten up!<03e0>Monsters? The more the merrier!
...You're happy as long as they buy<03e0>their refreshments here, right?
Some old-fashioned-looking woman is looking to<03e0>hire bodyguards, I hear. She's supposed to be<03e0>hanging out at a pub near the canal.
Interesting, huh?
Only weaklings need bodyguards.
...Not everyone is as strong as you.
Apparently, a lot of the treasures of the Old Kingdoms<03e0>are turning up on the black market.
Interesting, huh?
Out with the old, in with the new.
...I don't think that applies here.
Some guy is looking for these three stones that<03e0>play an important part in the desert's history.
Interesting, huh?
Someone's looking for stones?<03e0>There's a bunch in the back,<03e0>if anyone needs any.
Some guy researching the history of ancient magick<03e0>is looking for a little help. Maybe he can uncover<03e0>the secrets we've always wanted to know...
Interesting, huh?
Ooh! Maybe he can make me a love potion!
Apparently, some monster sealed by the Imperator<03e0>has appeared. It's really got people spooked, saying<03e0>it's the end of the world!
Interesting, huh?
Are we all going to die?<03e0>If that's the case, I'm going to withdraw my<03e0>life savings and go on a shopping spree!
...What are you going to do if<03e0>nothing happens and we're fine?
Some amnesiac is wandering around the cities<03e0>in the desert, looking for anything to help<03e0>regain his memory.
Interesting, huh?
Sometimes I wish I had amnesia.<03e0>There's a lot I'd like to forget about.
Don't worry. At your age, you'll be losing your memory<03e0>soon enough.
A notorious bandit is lurking around Athlum.<03e0>It seems he's waiting for someone but no one's<03e0>brave enough to ask.
Interesting, huh?
What if he tries to attack poor little me?<03e0>All bandits should be locked up!
There's a goddess statue in the Robelia Ruins<03e0>that's supposed to let you meet up with anyone<03e0>far away. A kid looking for his sister is asking about it.
Interesting, huh?
...<03e0>I...I have something in my eye...
...Are you crying!?
There's a murderer on the loose in the big city!
Interesting, huh?
What!?<03e0>Here!?
There's some massive yama looking for stuff.<03e0>He's acting kinda weird, though. People say<03e0>he's crazy.
Interesting, huh?
He's a yama, of course he's large.<03e0>...Anyway, I hope he comes here!
...Looking to make a profit, are you?
Some white qsiti's been looking for a mystical book.<03e0>People seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's<03e0>been able to place him.
Interesting, huh?
I've never liked the bookworm type.<03e0>He should go out and get some sun.
There's this set of twins that've turned up as<03e0>mercenaries lately...good ones, too. They're slightly<03e0>cold in attitude, but everyone wants to meet them!
Interesting, huh?
Men... *sigh*
Some fellow is hosting a game in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea. I wonder how<03e0>many people are gonna join in the fun.
Interesting, huh?
He has the right idea!<03e0>Life is all about fun.
...Strange, coming from a seedy barkeep<03e0>like yourself.
Some old warrior's crossed the Great Sand Sea,<03e0>looking for a special sword.
Interesting, huh?
Men love these kind of adventures.<03e0>I don't care if my man goes away<03e0>on a trip, as long as he keeps sending money!
...You are every man's nightmare.
A bunch of guards somewhere have sworn to<03e0>follow their ruler for as long as they live.
Interesting, huh?
If I were lord, I would work them<03e0>like my slaves.
There's not a family in the world as dedicated as<03e0>the Honeywells. If they've got your back,<03e0>you can relax.
Interesting, huh?
I wonder if they've got my back.
I heard in Royotia that apparently<03e0>Torgal of the Athlum generals is real<03e0>touchy about his past.
Interesting, huh?
Everyone has a touchy part of their<03e0>past. Some things I'll take with me<03e0>to the grave.
..Don't worry. No one's interested in<03e0>your past, anyway.
The competition to determine the Hero Exemplar<03e0>is about to start. I wonder how many are gonna<03e0>be up for the challenge.
Interesting, huh?
Yeah, good luck. Not interested.
I hear Mystic Arts Academy is a renowned school<03e0>and its graduates go on to do great things.
Interesting, huh?
With that kind of education, I bet<03e0>the graduates rake in the big bucks.
Athlum's had its share of hardships, and with<03e0>the new Honeywell girl being so young...<03e0>Well, people are worried.
Interesting, huh?
She'll do fine.<03e0>I have faith.
...Was that a compliment? From you?<03e0>What's wrong with you today?
A lot of the ladies are wondering why the Marquis<03e0>of Athlum has no lady in his life.<03e0>I can't see why<07f0>he's a good-looking fella.
Interesting, huh?
Who's to say he doesn't?<03e0>Ooh! I wish I could find out.
The ex-director of the Academy has been<03e0>spotted at pubs in various cities.
Interesting, huh?
She should come here!<03e0>I've always liked her!
...You just like her money.
It seems Dr. Sykes has been seen making frequent<03e0>trips to Athlum Castle lately.
Interesting, huh?
Dr. Sykes?<03e0>I used to work under her.
...You worked for the Academy?
A monster was spotted flying around Wyrmskeep.<03e0>It's got the town spooked!
Interesting, huh?
I wish a lot of things would go away,<03e0>but there are just some things you<03e0>have to live with.
Some bloodthirsty female warrior is trying to hunt down<03e0>the goons responsible for the incident at the moor,<03e0>against her boss's wishes.
Interesting, huh?
I wish some hottie would hunt ME down.
...Keep on dreaming.
A mob of ferocious monsters were spotted<03e0>in the Great Sand Sea. They're apparently so<03e0>powerful that Balterossa doesn't know what to do.
Interesting, huh?
Drama!<03e0>I should go have a looksie.
...You're a loon.
According to archaeologists, there's something<03e0>dangerous enough to destroy entire cities<03e0>hidden in the depths of a volcano.
Interesting, huh?
How scary!<03e0>But how much can you really trust<03e0>a weatherman's prediction?
...They're archaeologists, not meteorologists.
No one knows what's going on inside the volcano.<03e0>But lords have their ways of finding things out<07f003e0>no matter how impossible.
Interesting, huh?
How would a lord know something<03e0>a scientist doesn't even know?
...They have their ways.
A certain town just lost their lord, and<03e0>his two sons are fighting for the position.
Interesting, huh?
This has nothing to do with me.<03e0>I don't care.
...I'm sure they don't care about you, either.
They say that if you listen closely, you can<03e0>hear crying coming from the depths of<03e0>the Great Sand Sea.
Interesting, huh?
Crying? Someone's hurting?<03e0>How...tragic...
...Are you laughing?<03e0>...You're laughing, aren't you?
A long time ago, a hero lived in the Great Sand Sea.
Interesting, huh?
And?
...I don't know.
Some guy got the wits scared out of him in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea. He was talking to a pillar<03e0>when ghosts appeared out of nowhere.
Interesting, huh?
Guys who talk to pillars scare me more<03e0>than ghosts.
...True.
There's a man claiming to be a scientist<03e0>in Melphina. Apparently, we should stay away<03e0>from him because he's absolutely looney.
Interesting, huh?
Oh, that guy.
...A friend of yours?
There's a cafe in some city that's infested<03e0>with bugs from the desert. I hear the owner<03e0>is about to go crazy!
Interesting, huh?
How unsanitary.<03e0>I'm never going there.
Since the incident, Nagapur's become a real<03e0>dangerous area. There's lots of crime, especially<03e0>involving the kidnapping of young boys and girls.
Interesting, huh?
Kidnapping? Missing children?<03e0>That's just wrong!
A trend started in Royotia, where people would<03e0>exchange treasures they found on their adventures.<03e0>No one does that anymore, though.
Interesting, huh?
They would exchange treasures?<03e0>The only thing I would exchange<03e0>treasure for is cash.
Balterossa is the sole buyer of all of<03e0>Royotia's trade goods. There are countless merchants<03e0>who aren't too happy with the situation.
Interesting, huh?
I'm sure they're being resold at a reasonable<03e0>price, unlike the inflated price tags<03e0>the merchants would put on them.
...You just made enemies with every<03e0>merchant in the world.
A yamaan mercenary is looking for soldiers to<03e0>help him out. I bet he found himself a job too big<03e0>to take on alone.
Interesting, huh?
Mercenaries don't have a steady earning.<03e0>He needs to change careers.<03e0>Deskwork is always a good option.
...With the ongoing feuds, I'm sure<03e0>they get paid better than you do.
I heard some girl raving about a man in Celapaleis<03e0>who's sweet one second, but then angry the next.<03e0>She says he's her ideal man. Women...
Interesting, huh?
That's my ideal man, too!
...Really?
There's a qsiti who stands in the middle<03e0>of busy streets and glares at anyone<03e0>who bumps into him. Weird.
Interesting, huh?
Oh, I know him.
...Another friend of yours?
There's this intriguingly mysterious lady<03e0>who looks like she has the weight<03e0>of the world on her shoulders.
Interesting, huh?
I should try acting mysterious.<03e0>Maybe then people will pay attention to me!
There was a bunch of Bloody Alice soldiers<03e0>spotted at the moor. It looked like they were<03e0>getting ready to do something big.
Interesting, huh?
Those feminist bandits?<03e0>I hope they get eaten alive by<03e0>some horrid monster.
The Jhana are now causing a ruckus in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea. Apparently, not even<03e0>the Gae Bolg can teach them a lesson.
Interesting, huh?
They never learn...<03e0>Just like men.
...I resent that.
The Silver Falcons say they're going to get rid<03e0>of the Jhana. They're so dependable.
Interesting, huh?
It's not really their fault they don't<03e0>learn. Their race survives by stealing<03e0>from people. They don't think on their own.
...How do you know this?
The Silver Falcons are going to get<03e0>rid of what's left of the Conqueror's army.<03e0>Good riddance!
Interesting, huh?
Less soldiers means less customers...<03e0>Ah well.
A real gloomy-looking man comes here all the time.<03e0>He really creeps me out...
Interesting, huh?
I want to kick him out, but I have no real reason to.
...No one knows anything about him.

Once Lady Marion connected with<03e0>the Remnant, her soul traveled to<03e0>the Sacred Lands.<04e0>She still looks upon us from the heavens.<03e0>She prays for the souls of the dead to<03e0>safely reach the heavens to join her side.
When the dragon let out a fierce howl,<03e0>the lives of many were snatched away.<03e0>But we must not live in fear.<04e0>Lady Marion is always looking down upon us.<03e0>She wishes our souls to always be at peace.
This is the temple dedicated to Marion Marshall.<04e0>You saw the statue up front, didn't you? It's a statue<03e0>of Lady Marion. She has the most peaceful look on<03e0>her face, doesn't she?

I'm just here visiting, but seems to me that this place<03e0>really has a distinct air to it<07f0>one not found anyplace<03e0>else.<04e0>The people who come here really seem to believe that<03e0>the legendary Marion Marshall truly existed.<04e0>She is a beauty, isn't she? Seeing this statue, I can see<03e0>why they want to believe she existed!
I think I've begun to understand why so many people<03e0>come to places like this.<04e0>The thought of some higher power like Marion Marshall<03e0>watching over us really gives a sense of relief and<03e0>security.
This is the resting place of souls.<03e0>No one may enter.
What? You wish to go through these doors?<04e0>The Marquis of Athlum...!<03e0>Well, I can hardly say no to your lordship.<03e0>I will unlock the doors at once.<04e0>But please refrain from telling anyone<03e0>about this, my lord.
The Catacombs are beyond this door.<03e0>Fierce creatures roam within.<03e0>Be safe!
The doors are shut tight.

Irina!
It's a package from Mom and Dad!
Aw, it's probably just another lame excuse<0fe003e00ee0>why they can't leave their research.
Hey, cheer up, Sis.
Whoops.
It's a visistone.
Let me set it up.
Oh!
Hi, Rush! Hello, Irina!<0fe003e00ee0>Are you two behaving yourselves?
Both of us are having a great time here<0fe003e00ee0>at the Academy in Elysion.<1ae00000dc420fe005e001000ee0>And we were lucky enough to have<0fe003e00ee0>a breakthrough in our research...
But, as you probably guessed, things are<0fe003e00ee0>taking longer than expected...
See? Told you!
So your father and I agreed that you should<0fe003e00ee0>come live with us in Elysion.
It's always about what they want...
What we've found is a key that lets us use<0fe003e00ee0>the Remnants in new ways.<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>It's gonna change the world for the better!
But you kids are more important to us,<1ae00000aa420fe005e001000ee0>and I'm sorry we haven't been out<0fe003e00ee0>to visit for so long.
Oh...
John, we're running out of time<07f01ae0000070420fe002e001000be00ee0>
Oh? Ah, right.
We'll be sending someone to pick you up.
Better start packing your bags!
And Rush, you look after your sister,<0fe003e00ee0>alright?
Take care of yourselves.
We'll be seeing yo<07f01ae0000040420fe002e001000be002e0>
Out of time... Dad's never been good<0fe003e00ee0>at keeping track.
You worried about leaving?
A little... I mean, I've never been off<0fe003e00ee0>the island before.
Ah, I'll be fine!
After all, we'll be back with Mom and Dad!

So your talisman's more than a fashion<0fe003e00ee0>accessory after all.
My lord!
You did not have to come all this way<0fe003e00ee0>for me...
Please, accept my apologies.
Seeing you safe is apology enough.
And who is this?
He claims to be the son of Dr. Sykes...
I see.
I am Torgal, one of Athlum's Four Generals.
Our lord, the Marquis of Athlum, would like<0fe003e00ee0>to extend his thanks.<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>Step forward.
I will have you know that your actions<0fe003e00ee0>have won my gratitude.
As for your sister, if the men you seek<0fe003e00ee0>have entered Athlumian territory,<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>we cannot turn a blind eye.
I shall accompany you to Athlum.
Huh?
Our lord would like to aid you in<0fe003e00ee0>your search for your sister.
It's fine, Torgal.
Thanks a lot!<1ae000000c420fe005e001000ee0>I chased that weird flying thing here,<0fe003e00ee0>but I didn't have a clue where to go next.
But hey, if I've got an important guy<0fe003e00ee0>like you backing me up, <1ae00000e6420fe005e001000ee0>I've got a whole lot less to worry about!
This is ace!
The name's Rush... Rush Sykes!<0fe003e00ee0>Who're you?
I am David Nassau, the Marquis of Athlum.<0fe003e00ee0>You may address me as David.
Sure thing, Dave!
Let us return and see what tidings await us<0fe003e00ee0>in Athlum.
All troops return to Athlum immediately!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Come on, Dave! Let's go!
You whelp! Have you no manners!? <0fe003e00ee0>That is no way to address the Marquis of Athlum!
Geez! What's your problem!?
My only problem is your lack of<0fe003e00ee0>common sense!
He's surprisingly simple, wouldn't you say?

We can waste no time in sniffing out<0fe003e00ee0>the rats who kidnapped Irina.
Torgal?
Rush, we have prepared a room for you<0fe003e00ee0>within the castle.
After your journey from Eulam Island,<0fe003e00ee0>you must want to rest and recover from<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>your presumably arduous journey.
So I just sit on my butt and do nothing?<0fe003e00ee0>Yeah, right! I'll go find those guys myself!
Fine, do as you like. But try not to do<0fe003e00ee0>anything too foolish.
We shouldn't let him have free run of<0fe003e00ee0>the castle until we've verified his story.<1ae00000f0420fe005e001000ee0>I'll get on it.
Okay, uhh... I'm going now? Hello?
If it's information you seek, there is<0fe003e00ee0>a certain pub in Virtus Parish<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>you might care to investigate.
Come to the castle if you need anything of us.
Alright! I'm on it!

Young master! Rush Sykes has arrived!
Didja learn anything about Irina?
Pagus.
I am Pagus,<0fe003e00ee0>one of the Four Generals of Athlum.
As for Miss Irina, I regret to say that<0fe003e00ee0>we have yet to uncover any new leads...
Nevertheless, we have learned two<0fe003e00ee0>interesting facts.
One, some suspicious types were spotted<0fe003e00ee0>escorting a young girl to the Gaslin Caves.
That's gotta be<07f01ae0000020420fe002e001000be00ee0>
And the other thing?
We've also received reports of nocturnal<0fe003e00ee0>activity near the Robelia Castle ruins.
The ruins have long been a den<0fe003e00ee0>for petty thieves...<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>What's to say this is any different?
Not what, who.
A trusted source informs me that Athlumian<0fe003e00ee0>soldiers have been seen leaving the ruins...
That certainly is "interesting."
Hey, thanks, Pagus. I'll go check out<0fe003e00ee0>those two places right away.
Not so fast, Rush.<0fe003e00ee0>My Generals shall accompany you there.
Maintaining the peace and stability of<0fe003e00ee0>Athlum is our duty.<1ae00000d2420fe005e001000ee0>We cannot stand idly by while<0fe003e00ee0>she is threatened.
What's more, Master Rush is the son of<0fe003e00ee0>the world-famous Remnant researchers.
Naturally, we will do our utmost to aid<0fe003e00ee0>such an important family.
My apologies...<0fe003e00ee0>We had your background checked.
I'm used to it. Having famous parents<0fe003e00ee0>isn't all bad, you know.
It's all right, Emma. Go ahead.
Yes, my lord.
I was able to contact the Academy branch<0fe003e00ee0>in Celapaleis.<1ae00000d2420fe005e001000ee0>I informed them that we would be<0fe003e00ee0>taking care of Rush.
You talked to the Academy?<0fe003e00ee0>That's a relief and a half...
I'd given up trying to get in touch<0fe003e00ee0>with them...<1ae000008c420fe005e001000ee0>I mean, it's like shouting at a brick wall.
It is a group prone to secrecy.
You're a lifesaver, Emma.
Still, it's uncertain when or if the message<0fe003e00ee0>will get to the headquarters in Elysion...
Of course it will!<0fe003e00ee0>Come on, my sister was kidnapped.<1ae00000b4420fe005e001000ee0>Even the Academy suits wouldn't keep that<0fe003e00ee0>from Mom and Dad!
Bear in mind, the Sykes are presently<0fe003e00ee0>involved in top-level research.<1ae00000f0420fe005e001000ee0>It may take some time for them to respond.
Until then, I will assist you by<0fe003e00ee0>any means necessary.
Sounds good to me!

Thank you! Finally, we can go back home...<03e0>Hm? No, I haven't seen any other girls but us.<03e0>I don't think those hoodlums got anyone else...
Thank you so much! I'll never forget this!
So, from the look on yer face, I can tell you didn't<03e0>find your sis. Thinking about where we are an' why,<03e0>I dunno if that's a good or a bad thing...<04e0>Anyway, there's no point in getting all down about it,<03e0>right? C'mon, let's head back to Athlum.

So! As you see, Remnants are nothing<0fe003e00ee0>more than evil charms meant to add<1ae0000052430fe005e001000ee0>to the depravity of man!
You may not see the effects now, but not<0fe003e00ee0>far into the future, terrible disaster awaits!<1ae0000087430fe005e001000ee0>By then it will be too late to change<0fe003e00ee0>our sinful ways!
Men are meant to work hard and make<0fe003e00ee0>their own way!<1ae0000016430fe005e001000ee0>We must not accept the temptations of<0fe003e00ee0>easy life that Remnants provide!
Yeah!
Stand up and fight!<1ae000008c420fe005e001000ee0>The first step is here<07f0>we will strike<0fe003e00ee0>Athlum with the hammer of justice!
See our allies here dressed as Athlumian<0fe003e00ee0>soldiers! They will infiltrate that city<1ae0000052430fe005e001000ee0>of sin and cause a disturbance.<1ae00000be420fe005e001000ee0>That will be our chance! Come! Let us<0fe003e00ee0>liberate the people from their chains!
Wh-what the heck is this!?
Seems like an anti-Remnant activist rally.
Sounds more like anti-Remnant terrorist<0fe003e00ee0>activity to me!<1ae00000b4420fe005e001000ee0>Whatever they're planning's gotta<0fe003e00ee0>be dangerous!
Who's there!?
Oho! It seems we have guests...lackeys of<0fe003e00ee0>that magick-abusing Marquis of Athlum!<1ae0000087430fe005e001000ee0>Look closely at their faces, <0fe003e00ee0>shining with depravity!
Woe, for it is too late for these<0fe003e00ee0>unbelievers to be saved.
Yet they can serve some purpose<07f0>a prelude<0fe003e00ee0>to the cleansing of Athlum.<1ae0000034430fe005e001000ee0>We shall christen our movement with<0fe003e00ee0>the blood of these servants of evil!
This guy's psycho!

Miss Irina wasn't here?<04e0>I see... Although, perhaps it is for the best.<03e0>For now, let us return to Athlum.
The men?<03e0>I suppose we ought to take them into custody for now.<04e0>Of course, they haven't done anything yet, so we'd<03e0>just release them right away... Either way there's<03e0>no need to worry about it.
Get away from me, Remnant-user!
What...what're you trying to do?<03e0>Leave me alone!
To have such overwhelming power...<03e0>No, Remnants are nothing but trouble.
Remnants aren't a necessity!<03e0>Why can't you understand that!?
Irina?<03e0>Sorry, I've never heard of her.
We won't give in to oppression!

A slave-trading syndicate and anti-Remnant<0fe003e00ee0>terrorists... Lovely.
And to think, while we were fighting<0fe003e00ee0>beastmen, those fiends were doing<1ae00000d6420fe005e001000ee0>as they pleased...
We are already looking into this,<0fe003e00ee0>Lord David.<1ae00000c0420fe005e001000ee0>You should not trouble yourself further.
More importantly, we have learned of<0fe003e00ee0>something else similarly...troubling.
Multiple sources have reported seeing<0fe003e00ee0>a bright light flash across the sky.
A flash?
Every so often, Remnants emit light...<0fe003e00ee0>It's called "Luminescence."
The light could've been Luminesence from<0fe003e00ee0>the Valeria Heart or the Gae Bolg<1ae0000005430fe005e001000ee0>reflected on the clouds.
Ah, but the Valeria Heart and<0fe003e00ee0>the Gae Bolg are bound.<1ae000000c430fe005e001000ee0>They have not seen a Luminescence in<0fe003e00ee0>a long, long while.
Then, maybe a different Remnant?
That light moved as if it possessed<0fe003e00ee0>a mind of its own.<1ae000000c430fe005e001000ee0>Very different from Luminescence,<0fe003e00ee0>to be sure.
Then, a flying monster!?
So it would seem.
Where was the light headed?
Towards Dillmoor.
Fine. You four take Rush and head to<0fe003e00ee0>Dillmoor immediately.
It seems we're up against a flying Remnant.
No way! Th-that's impossible!
The Academy's research on newly<0fe003e00ee0>discovered Remnants may be ongoing,<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>but they have never announced a Remnant<0fe003e00ee0>with the power of flight.
No... It must be a Remnant.<0fe003e00ee0>No other possibility makes sense.
Now we're up against a group that has<0fe003e00ee0>its hands on an unknown Remnant.
Choose your battles with discretion.<0fe003e00ee0>Retrieving Irina is top priority.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
Don't sweat it, Dave. We're the good guys,<0fe003e00ee0>we'll definitely get Irina back!

This was once a prosperous town.<1ae00000b8420fe005e001000ee0>It was centered around the Remnant of<0fe003e00ee0>Peace, the Rubber Soul.
Was there a war?
No. The one the Remnant was bound to<0fe003e00ee0>passed away.
The world is filled with countless<0fe003e00ee0>Remnants<07f0>no two look alike<1ae0000020430fe005e001000ee0>or share the same power.
However, they all have one thing<0fe003e00ee0>in common.
And...that is?
When a Remnant is not bound to a soul,<0fe003e00ee0>it calls forth disastrous misfortune.<1ae0000052430fe005e001000ee0>This calamity is known as the "Collapse."
Shhh! Hide yourselves!
I see them. Two men...<0fe003e00ee0>And...a dark-haired little girl.
What did you do to her!?
This must be our cue.
Irina!
It's triggered another Collapse!

It was as you said, Lord David. The flying<0fe003e00ee0>creature is unquestionably a Remnant.
Confirm this with the Academy.
Yes, my lord.
Who could be behind all this?
We do not know enough at this point.<1ae00000dc420fe005e001000ee0>Verily, this situation is more complex<0fe003e00ee0>than we'd imagined.
Yes, we should postpone any course<0fe003e00ee0>of action until we know more.
What about Irina?<0fe003e00ee0>Should I just keep my fingers crossed?
We are not dealing with an ordinary foe.<0fe003e00ee0>A well-researched plan is essential.
Dave, c'mon!
Torgal is correct.
We are dealing with forces that control<0fe003e00ee0>a Remnant not even<1ae00000a4420fe005e001000ee0>the Academy knows about.
Jumping to conclusions will only place<0fe003e00ee0>Athlum in danger.<1ae00000fa420fe005e001000ee0>You must understand my position, Rush.
Where are you going?
To find Irina. Obviously.
You know how the people of Athlum are<0fe003e00ee0>the most important things in your life?<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>Well, Irina's the most important thing<0fe003e00ee0>in mine.
Well, thanks for the help along the way.<0fe003e00ee0>I'll go it alone from here.
Lord David, we still know nothing about<0fe003e00ee0>his talisman.
Perhaps we should have stopped him.
Perhaps. I am aware that we need more<0fe003e00ee0>power, as the Gae Bolg and Valeria Heart<1ae0000022430fe005e001000ee0>won't suffice.
The future of Athlum is at stake here.

This whole deal makes me sick.<0fe003e00ee0>She's just a kid!
I am merely following the Lord's orders.<0fe003e00ee0>As you should follow mine.

That is all, Lord David.<0fe003e00ee0>I pray for your success.
You're here.
Who was that?
Ah, ahem, yes. A messenger from Celapaleis.<0fe003e00ee0>Sent by the Duke of Qubine.
He wanted to warn us about some<0fe003e00ee0>unidentified troops invading Blackdale.
He believes they're troops from the Duke<0fe003e00ee0>of Ghor. We are to look into it immediately.
But I thought Blackdale belonged<0fe003e00ee0>to Athlum.<1ae000008c420fe005e001000ee0>Why's this guy butting into your business?
It was merely a request, not an order.
And although we are allies, Athlum is<0fe003e00ee0>actually under the control of Celapaleis.<1ae000002c430fe005e001000ee0>We have little say.
Huh.
So what do you need me for?
You will be joining us in our investigation.
Why's that?
Pagus?
According to the report,<0fe003e00ee0>the troops from Ghor that entered<1ae0000007430fe005e001000ee0>Blackdale were led by a mage dressed<0fe003e00ee0>in white.
Not only that, but they were accompanied<0fe003e00ee0>by a flying Remnant.
That sounds like someone we know.<0fe003e00ee0>Like those guys we saw at Dillmoor!
We must make haste.<0fe003e00ee0>Prepare for departure at once.
Wait, you're going?<0fe003e00ee0>Aren't you too important for this?
I was requested to go as well.
And if nothing else,<0fe003e00ee0>it should satisfy my curiosity.
We are leaving for Blackdale immediately!<0fe003e00ee0>Is that clear?
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!

Irina. You must bind this Remnant to<0fe003e00ee0>yourself. You must release its power.
For that power will change the world...<0fe003e00ee0>Why, it might even bring back the dead.
You mean...?
We'd like to see your brother again,<0fe003e00ee0>wouldn't we?
Irina!
Rush, they have a hostage.<0fe003e00ee0>You must stay calm.
But...!
Listen, these people are dangerous and<0fe003e00ee0>we don't know what they're capable of.
Well, well! If it isn't the Marquis of Athlum!
You know of me? How fortunate.
Your acts of aggression have not gone<0fe003e00ee0>unnoticed. We know how you manipulated<1ae000000c430fe005e001000ee0>both the Rubber Soul and the Schiavona.<0fe003e00ee0>And let's not forget the kidnapping...
Your actions are in violation of<0fe003e00ee0>Congressional decree, and for this<1ae00000fa420fe005e001000ee0>you will be punished!
Both of us are men of reason, Marquis.<1ae00000aa420fe005e001000ee0>A man of your stature surely realizes<0fe003e00ee0>the...impracticality of certain laws.

Will that be all?
No! You will release her and surrender<0fe003e00ee0>immediately!
Do you think we won't harm you just<0fe003e00ee0>because you're the Marquis of Athlum?
Your confidence implies you are not alone.<1ae00000c4420fe005e001000ee0>Who is your ally?<0fe003e00ee0>The Duke of Ghor, perhaps?
By now, you must be aware of<0fe003e00ee0>the Academy's response...<1ae0000048430fe005e001000ee0>or lack thereof.
You... You're part of the Academy?

She has finally come to understand that.

It's a shame they do not share<0fe003e00ee0>the same power...

So, not only do you let this mysterious<0fe003e00ee0>creature slip through your fingers,<1ae000002a430fe005e001000ee0>but you're also clueless as to<0fe003e00ee0>its affiliation, and its purpose?
A fine report this is.
My word. Is Athlum completely powerless<0fe003e00ee0>over its own territory?
Bah... It seems the apple does fall<0fe003e00ee0>far from the tree.

Come now, calm down...
Why the false report to the Duke?
You believe those men are connected<0fe003e00ee0>to the Academy...
You don't?
The Academy conducts research in<0fe003e00ee0>a number of fields.<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>Rumors would indicate that includes<0fe003e00ee0>forbidden experimentation with Remnants...
It is possible that our mage in white<0fe003e00ee0>is connected.
And the Academy holds tremendous<0fe003e00ee0>influence across the world.<1ae00000f2420fe005e001000ee0>Celapaleis is no exception.
You don't think the Duke of Qubine is<0fe003e00ee0>involved in this...?
I don't know.<0fe003e00ee0>But until I do, we're playing it safe.
I don't want Qubine knowing our strategy<0fe003e00ee0>just yet.
Understood. But do take care not to<0fe003e00ee0>overplay your hand.<1ae0000016430fe005e001000ee0>If Athlum is lost, those machinations<0fe003e00ee0>of yours will be for naught.

Rush! You need to calm down.<0fe003e00ee0>Irina is alive.
How do you<07f01ae000008a420fe002e001000be00ee0>
After we left, a strange flying creature<0fe003e00ee0>was seen leaving Blackdale.<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>A girl was spotted as well...
After comparing a few more reports,<0fe003e00ee0>we are certain it was Irina.
F-for real?
I had Pagus confirm it personally.<0fe003e00ee0>Without a doubt, your sister lives, Rush.
What is it?
...Even if she's alive, I'm not strong<0fe003e00ee0>enough to save her...
Pull yourself together, Rush! You need to<0fe003e00ee0>keep whatever strength you do have!
If you won't save her, who will?
You're right... I've got to find a way.
As I said, I'll help you as much as I can.<0fe003e00ee0>It's still far too early to give up hope!
Dave... Thanks.
Yes... well. That Wagram character implied<0fe003e00ee0>he was an Academy member.<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>If that's true, it means this plot is much deeper<0fe003e00ee0>than we imagined. You cannot face it alone.<1ae0000043430fe005e001000ee0>Moreover... Irina saved us.<0fe003e00ee0>I owe her my life.<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>And men of Athlum always repay<0fe003e00ee0>their debts.
You sure it's okay to just help us<0fe003e00ee0>like that? Torgal's not gonna be happy...
Heh. Cleaning up my messes is his job...<0fe003e00ee0>Has been since I was a baby.
Oh, man. That's gross.
Once we learn where that flying creature<0fe003e00ee0>is headed, I'll let you know.
Okay. I'll keep an eye out, too.
Lord David...<0fe003e00ee0>You still intend to look into this matter?
Of course. As if I would allow such<0fe003e00ee0>low fiends to sully Athlum!
That mage... Find out who that Wagram really is,<0fe003e00ee0>even if it means shaking up the Academy!
Yes, my lord.

There you are.
What's going on?
Rush, the Congress will be holding<0fe003e00ee0>a session in Elysion several days from now.
The Congress? What's that?
Put simply, the Congress is a group<0fe003e00ee0>that makes sure the world plays nice.<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>Once every few years, the Lords meet and<0fe003e00ee0>discuss pressing matters.
We'll be heading to Elysion as well.
So, you just called me here to<0fe003e00ee0>say goodbye?
Oh, no. On the contrary, traveling with us<0fe003e00ee0>should be a free ticket into Elysion.
Gaining entrance to Elysion during<0fe003e00ee0>a Congress year is especially difficult.
And let's not forget the increased security,<0fe003e00ee0>what with the influx of important figures.
So if I can get to Elysion,<0fe003e00ee0>I can go to the Academy!<1ae00000ec420fe005e001000ee0>Aw, Dave, that's absolutely mint!
Though who knows if Lord David will even<0fe003e00ee0>be invited to the assembly meeting...
What do you mean?
Usually, only the most powerful leaders<0fe003e00ee0>are called to the Congress.<1ae0000007430fe005e001000ee0>It's likely that a young successor like<0fe003e00ee0>me won't be asked to participate.
...Did you piss someone off?
Not yet... I've merely been asking around<0fe003e00ee0>about someone who might be responsible<1ae000002a430fe005e001000ee0>for the shady dealings at the Academy.
Who?
Top man at the Academy, and Chairman of<0fe003e00ee0>the Congress...
The Lord of Nagapur,<0fe003e00ee0>Duke Wilfred Hermeien.
Wilfred Hermeien, huh...<0fe003e00ee0>So that's the guy who took Irina?
That's what I aim to find out.
Lord David!
The House of Hermeien has chaired<0fe003e00ee0>the Congress for generations.<1ae00000fa420fe005e001000ee0>If provoked, they will not hesitate<0fe003e00ee0>to turn all the Lords against you.
The late Marquis made painstaking efforts<0fe003e00ee0>to maintain peaceful relations with<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>the Chairman. If you would only consider<0fe003e00ee0>what is best for Athlum...
So I still cannot compare to my father,<0fe003e00ee0>hmm?
Enough discussion. We'll continue this<0fe003e00ee0>when we reach Elysion.<1ae00000e8420fe005e001000ee0>Begin preparations to leave.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
H-hey, Dave...
What is it?
Uh... nothing, never mind.<0fe003e00ee0>Catch ya later!
Hrn.

So this is the girl...
Yes, my lord...
So you're the big man in charge.<0fe003e00ee0>Just what do you want from me?
Feisty one, this is.<0fe003e00ee0>Just like her mother.
You...know my mother?
I loathe such women.<0fe003e00ee0>Women are meant to be servile.
And you are of no exception, so don't<0fe003e00ee0>you dare speak to me in that manner again.<1ae0000024430fe005e001000ee0>...Unless you wish to be fed to Harpylia!
M-my lord...
Oh, I only jest. I wouldn't dream<0fe003e00ee0>of treating her like the others.
This one is irreplaceable, after all.<0fe003e00ee0>You must treat her well, Wagram.
Yes, my lord.
Rush!

Wow...
That is the Elysion Remnant.<0fe003e00ee0>Its power keeps the world in balance.
A thousand years ago, the great Marion<0fe003e00ee0>Marshall bound herself to the Remnant,<1ae0000052430fe005e001000ee0>marking this as the birthplace of<0fe003e00ee0>Remnant culture.
Huh...
I thought you were originally from Elysion.
Yeah, I was born here, but we moved to<0fe003e00ee0>Eulam when I was still a baby.<1ae00000f0420fe005e001000ee0>I don't remember Elysion at all.
Lord David?
Right. Let's head to the embassy.

The Assembly still hasn't started?
Not yet. The Dukes of Ghor and Qubine<0fe003e00ee0>have yet to arrive.
I suppose the perks of dukedom include<0fe003e00ee0>never having to be on time...
That being the case...<0fe003e00ee0>Rush, let's take a walk, shall we?
Uhh, is that okay?
I'll be summoned when the time comes.
Besides, matters should be simplified<0fe003e00ee0>if you stay near me, Rush.<1ae00000f0420fe005e001000ee0>I trust there are no complaints?
Not so long as you allow us to accompany<0fe003e00ee0>you, my lord.
Of course. Let us take this opportunity<0fe003e00ee0>to collect as much information as possible.<1ae0000021430fe005e001000ee0>And we wouldn't want to miss out on<0fe003e00ee0>paying the Academy a visit.

Look!
Who are they?
Does anyone know who that is?
They call him "the Conqueror."
How dare he bring his troops!
That big guy must be him!
I am Roeas, messenger for his lordship,<0fe003e00ee0>the Conqueror!
We hail from the eastern city of Veyriel.<0fe003e00ee0>We've come for the Remnant entrusted to us<1ae000002a430fe005e001000ee0>by the prophecy of the God Emperor!
His lordship promises prosperity to all!<0fe003e00ee0>The mark of this promise will soon be<1ae0000034430fe005e001000ee0>apparent to the world!
The Remnant will awaken;<0fe003e00ee0>time will be stagnant no more.<1ae000000c430fe005e001000ee0>The promised time is almost upon us.<0fe003e00ee0>Your dreams will soon become reality!
...
What rot! A prophecy!? The God Emperor<0fe003e00ee0>would never aid them!
Ignore them. Let them say what they will.
They have brought their troops here, to Elysion.<0fe003e00ee0>Perhaps there is truth to their words.
But did they threaten the God Emperor into<0fe003e00ee0>siding with them?
A friend of yours?
What is going on? What has he done?
I don't know.<0fe003e00ee0>But...there's something about that guy...
He's gone!
I need to find him.
Alright.

Move. I am finished here.
Please, the Chairman will be here<0fe003e00ee0>any moment!
Please, just a moment longer,<0fe003e00ee0>Lord Conqueror!
Conqueror...?
You alright?
Chairman Hermeien!
I am the Chairman of the Congress,<0fe003e00ee0>Duke Wilfred Hermeien.
Mister...Conqueror, is it?<0fe003e00ee0>If you could please state your intentions.
I believe you know my intentions.
You want to be named a Lord,<0fe003e00ee0>and get your own Remnant, hmm?
Inconceivable, taking over a backwater<0fe003e00ee0>place like Veyriel and then expecting to<07f01ae0000047430fe002e001000be00ee0>
I believe you were told to wait patiently<0fe003e00ee0>until the Congress handed down<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>its decision.
I am he whose coming was foretold by<0fe003e00ee0>the God Emperor himself.<1ae0000000430fe005e001000ee0>What need have I of the Congress's blessing?
The days when the God Emperor's word was<0fe003e00ee0>law are long gone.<1ae000000c430fe005e001000ee0>He should know that more than anyone...
It matters not. You would not give me<0fe003e00ee0>a Remnant, so I took one myself.<1ae0000048430fe005e001000ee0>My intentions have already been fulfilled.
You bound the Ark?<1ae00000b4420fe005e001000ee01ae000002041>Well, forgive me if I'm skeptical.
They have borne witness.
And you are...?
I am Torgal,<0fe003e00ee0>one of the Four Generals of Athlum.
And you saw this?
Yes... Without a doubt, the Conqueror<0fe003e00ee0>bound himself to the Ark.
Hmmm.
I-impossible...<0fe003e00ee0>I didn't think the Ark could be bound!
H-he's just like Marshall...!
We are finished now.
Wait!
Fair is fair. You can be a Lord.
We'll even grant you a Remnant. So...
Understood. I shall release the Ark.
Today's meeting of the Congress is on<0fe003e00ee0>indefinite recess!
An update will be forthcoming, so Lords<0fe003e00ee0>will take no actions 'til it does!
Marquis of Athlum!
I trust you understand the meaning of<0fe003e00ee0>no actions.
Sorry, Dave.<0fe003e00ee0>Everything's all screwed up now...
By no fault of yours, Rush. To the embassy.<0fe003e00ee0>We'll discuss things there.

So... What exactly is the Conqueror?
He's certainly no ordinary being.
There's something...off about him. As if<07f01ae000005d430fe002e001000be00ee0>
Hmm. It's hard to put into words.
And I have to question his relation to<0fe003e00ee0>the God Emperor.
Let's...deal with this later.<1ae00000b4420fe005e001000ee0>For now, we have to focus on Irina, and<0fe003e00ee0>the Academy blackguards who took her.
You learn anything new?
Chairman Hermeien revealed that<0fe003e00ee0>the Academy was involved with both<1ae00000d0420fe005e001000ee0>Irina's kidnapping and the invasions<0fe003e00ee0>into Athlum.
Apparently, some members of the Academy<0fe003e00ee0>are bent on conducting forbidden research.<1ae000000c430fe005e001000ee0>The mage Wagram is their ringleader.
That jerk! So, where's Irina?
Unfortunately, not even the Chairman<0fe003e00ee0>knows your sister's whereabouts.
An investigation is underway,<0fe003e00ee0>so we're to wait patiently.
Yeah. "Don't go out making trouble,"<0fe003e00ee0>is what it sounds like.
Well, it's not like Duke Hermeien could<0fe003e00ee0>say anything else.
As head of the Academy, anything that<0fe003e00ee0>tarnishes its reputation stains his as well.
So...<0fe003e00ee0>All we can do now is sit around and wait?
For now, yes.
Or at least that's what I'm supposed to say,<0fe003e00ee0>but things are never that simple, are they?
I found out what happened to the Sykes...<0fe003e00ee0>on the condition that I kept quiet about<1ae0000006430fe005e001000ee0>the Academy's involvement.
It seems that your family has been<0fe003e00ee0>transferred to a new facility.<1ae0000007430fe005e001000ee0>It's being kept quiet, but...<0fe003e00ee0>They are within the Temple of Elysion.
Right. I'm on my way!
Wait. We will accompany you.
Huh?
I'd worry if I left you alone. Moreover...
There is still more to this matter than<0fe003e00ee0>meets the eye.<1ae00000dc420fe005e001000ee0>I hope this trip can provide some answers.<0fe003e00ee0>Any objections?

You're...the Marquis of Athlum!
What's that?
This...is what Irina's kidnappers are after.
This tablet can put Remnants into...a deep<0fe003e00ee0>slumber. It was developed by your mother.
Where is she, anyway?
She's out there,<0fe003e00ee0>luring them away from this.
What!?
Don't worry. With this, getting Irina<0fe003e00ee0>back should be a snap.<1ae0000006430fe005e001000ee0>Your mother will be back soon.
You've done well, Rush.<0fe003e00ee0>We're going to be fine.

That reminds me. Do you remember what<0fe003e00ee0>Dr. Sykes told us earlier?<1ae000002a430fe005e001000ee0>About Ms. Marina luring away the others?
What did he mean by that?
I'm at a loss...
I think I may have an idea of<0fe003e00ee0>her whereabouts.
Really?
A fine time to tell us!
I must ask a favor. I wish to seek her out<0fe003e00ee0>in the company of Rush, and Rush alone.
Just the two of you?
Yes, my lord...
Would you care to explain why?
I see.

You have been a faithful servant to Athlum<0fe003e00ee0>for many years. I place my trust in you.
Lord David...

We have an old family tradition.<0fe003e00ee0>To carry on the Honeywell name, one must<1ae000000c430fe005e001000ee0>journey to find Remnants when one<0fe003e00ee0>reaches adulthood.
That's cool.
My father died in the war.<1ae00000a0420fe005e001000ee0>But he dreamed of a new great<0fe003e00ee0>Athlumian Remnant...
I decided to search here after I heard<0fe003e00ee0>the Academy had its eye on this place.<1ae00000e6420fe005e001000ee0>I thought perhaps I could find one...
And then...I met her.

I need some fresh air.
Your father...
He won't wake up.<1ae0000048420fe005e001000ee0>Dave said that only Wagram has<0fe003e00ee0>the power to bring him out of it.
Mom.
Me and Irina<07f0>we've both got the power<0fe003e00ee0>to call out to Remnants.
All of this is happening because of<0fe003e00ee0>our powers, right?<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee01ae0000048420fe005e001000ee0>I need to know!
What are we?<0fe003e00ee0>And what does that make you?
I was an orphan.<1ae00000a8420fe005e001000ee01ae000008c420fe005e001000ee0>The director of the Academy<03e0>took me in when I was a child.
To return the favor, I joined the Academy<0fe003e00ee0>and dedicated my life to their research.
That's where I learned the truth<0fe003e00ee0>about who I was.
You might have heard of Marion Marshall.<0fe003e00ee01ae00000dc420fe005e001000ee0>She was the woman who bound the Remnant<03e0>Elysion to herself, and wed the God Emperor.
The power she held was extraordinary<07f00fe003e00ee01ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>the power to erase the bindings of<03e0>Remnants and replace them with her own.
Inside me rests that same, terrible power.
For I...<0fe003e00ee0>I possess Marion's Blessing...as does Irina.
I didn't know about it until after<0fe003e00ee0>Irina was born. Oh, if only I'd known!<1ae0000048430fe005e001000ee0>To think, such terrible things are<0fe003e00ee0>happening to her, all because of me...
Mom...
You met Dad, I came along and then with<0fe003e00ee0>Irina, the four of us became a family.<1ae0000020430fe005e001000ee0>Were you... Were you happy with that?
I have never regretted having a family.<0fe003e00ee0>And I never will.<1ae0000034430fe005e001000ee0>The three of you are what<0fe003e00ee0>make up my happiness.
Then there's only one thing we can do.<0fe003e00ee0>We can get that back and be a family again!
They want Marion's Blessing for themselves, right?<1ae0000096420fe005e001000ee0>Then they're not gonna hurt Irina.<0fe003e00ee0>We've still got a chance to save her!

Thank you. I know what I have to do now.<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee01ae0000070420fe005e001000ee0>Here.
I made it using the tablet. When you find<0fe003e00ee0>Irina, I want you to give her this for me.
But what are you gonna do, Mom?
For now, you should just concentrate on<0fe003e00ee0>finding Irina.
Rush... Please, do as I say.
Mom...?
Where has she run off to now?<0fe003e00ee0>Her actions make no sense.<1ae000000c430fe005e001000ee0>Instead of acting on her own, she should<0fe003e00ee0>have come with us to Athlum and explained<1ae0000016430fe005e001000ee0>everything to Lord David.
I don't get it either. But...<0fe003e00ee0>Don't talk bad about my mom.<1ae0000005430fe005e001000ee0>I'm sure she knows what she's doing.
...Fair enough. But you can do<0fe003e00ee0>the explaining to Lord David.

Guard the gates!
Yes, sir!
Come on! Get a move on!
What's going on?
Come on, hurry!
Lady Emma! Rush!
Thank the Emperor you're back safe!
Like there was any doubt!
Things have gotten worse, haven't they...
Yes. The Congress has been slow to grant<0fe003e00ee0>that Conqueror fellow a Remnant,<1ae000003e430fe005e001000ee0>and all the Lords are in a flurry over it.
And the Conqueror keeps rattling his saber<0fe003e00ee0>about taking over countries and seizing<1ae0000016430fe005e001000ee0>their Remnants...
You'd expect that from the sort of person<0fe003e00ee0>who would bind the Ark...
He's made an enemy out of every Lord with<0fe003e00ee0>a Remnant. What's he plotting?
For starters, he's building an army.
So it's come to war...
Where's Dave?
He's meeting with an envoy from<0fe003e00ee0>Duke Hermeien.
What's Hermeien want?
Our cooperation, apparently.
Torgal.
You see, the Congress has split into<0fe003e00ee0>two factions...
One sides with the Chairman against<0fe003e00ee0>the Conqueror.
The other supports the Conqueror, fearing<0fe003e00ee0>the God Emperor's wrath.
Duke Hermeien wishes to ally with us and<0fe003e00ee0>end the rift as quickly as possible.
He's asked to speak with me directly,<0fe003e00ee0>in Nagapur.
What will you do?
Take advantage of the opportunity,<0fe003e00ee0>of course.
Lord David...?
In exchange for supporting Duke Hermeien,<0fe003e00ee0>I'll have him support Athlum's bid<1ae00000f8420fe005e001000ee0>for independence.
Think of it.<0fe003e00ee0>We could finally be free from Celapaleis!
We're hardly in a position to negotiate<0fe003e00ee0>after what happened with the Academy...
Perhaps not, but it makes little difference.
We can barely touch the Gae Bolg without<0fe003e00ee0>the Duke of Qubine's blessing.
Why must it be so difficult for Athlum<0fe003e00ee0>to protect herself?
Our country deserves more than this.<0fe003e00ee0>This is a chance we have to take!
Emma.
It's good to see you back safely.
I continue to ask your aid, for<0fe003e00ee0>the glory of Athlum.
My life is yours.
We leave for Nagapur shortly!<0fe003e00ee0>Make haste in your preparations!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!

Is there really gonna be a war?
It seems unavoidable at this point.
Huhhh...
Once war breaks out, the Remnants will<0fe003e00ee0>be played against each other...
And all that will remain is scorched earth,<0fe003e00ee0>littered with corpses and Blank Remnants<1ae000002a430fe005e001000ee0>that have lost those they were bound to.
These are dark days we live in...
Forgive me. I had something to ask you...<0fe003e00ee0>Did you finally meet with your mother?
Yeah...
Well?
Dave...promise me something.
I'll fight for you...for Athlum.<1ae000008c420fe005e001000ee0>But please, don't get Irina or my mom<0fe003e00ee0>mixed up in this, okay?
You have my word.
Thanks, Dave.
That's all you had to say?
Uhh...yeah.
You'd better hurry and get ready, then.

The Conqueror's on the move!
What?
Lord David!
Emma, Pagus, Rush. We must leave now.
What's going on? Where's Wilfred?
Our meeting has been postponed.<0fe003e00ee0>The Conqueror is marching on Celapaleis.
We've been called back as support. We'll<0fe003e00ee0>return to Athlum, then prepare for battle!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Rush.
Irina's here!?
Apparently, she's in Duke Hermeien's<0fe003e00ee0>custody.
I suppose you can rest easy, knowing<0fe003e00ee0>she's out of Wagram's hands.
Wha<07f0>no! Why didn't you take her with you?
Well, I didn't meet with her directly...<0fe003e00ee0>What's wrong?
Irina<07f00fe003e00ee0>Irina's got Marion's Blessing!
...And you think Lord Hermeien is aware<0fe003e00ee0>of this.
Wait! Where are you going?
I have to go save her!<0fe003e00ee0>I can't let him use her power!
Calm down and think for a moment!<1ae0000070420fe005e001000ee0>How are you to save her if you don't<0fe003e00ee0>even know where to find her!?
Rush, there is only one thing we can do<0fe003e00ee0>right now.
We must stop this war before anyone has<0fe003e00ee0>a chance to use her power!
I promise you we will come back for Irina.
...Fine.

Sir, the Conqueror's forces and the Duke<0fe003e00ee0>of Qubine's guard have met at<1ae0000015430fe005e001000ee0>the Nest of Eagles.
And it seems Celapaleis is taking quite<0fe003e00ee0>a beating.
Torgal, Blocter...<0fe003e00ee0>We'd better hurry to assist them.
Pagus, Emma, you and Rush stay here<0fe003e00ee0>and keep watch over Athlum.
Lord David, if I may speak.
The Conqueror raised an army and<0fe003e00ee0>attacked Celapaleis without giving us<1ae00000dc420fe005e001000ee0>a second thought.
Our enemy's strength and impudence are<0fe003e00ee0>clear...as are the consequences of<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>this battle.<0fe003e00ee0>If Celapaleis falls, Athlum will be next.
If even one extra man could increase<0fe003e00ee0>your chances, you should take him.
Emma...
Take the others.<0fe003e00ee0>I will protect Athlum with my life!
Understood. Take good care of her.
Yes, my lord.
Come on, men. All forces, to arms!

Evacuate quickly! Now!
He's a monster!
Help me!
Over here! Quickly!
What is he doing here!?
Get back!
The Valeria Heart...<0fe003e00ee0>Did it...?
The...tablet...
Bastard...why do you...
What's going on?
I don't know<07f01ae0000028420fe002e001000be00600000000000000>

Rush...
Mom...
If it weren't for that tablet...
Emma...
We can't locate Lord David,<0fe003e00ee0>nor can we find Emma's sword...
Lord David lost his mother when he was<0fe003e00ee0>just a child.<1ae000000f430fe005e001000ee0>Emma was a mother figure to him.<0fe003e00ee0>It's improbable, but...
I'll find him.
This was my mother's garden.<1ae00000a0420fe005e001000ee0>My father burned it when she died.<1ae00000b4420fe005e001000ee0>But...Emma gave it new life.
From the day I was bound to a Remnant,<0fe003e00ee0>I felt nothing but hatred for the world.<1ae000003f430fe005e001000ee0>But through these flowers, Emma reminded<0fe003e00ee0>me of the good still left in all of us.
So...
Duke Hermeien could announce his decision<0fe003e00ee0>to vanquish the Conqueror at any minute.<1ae000001b430fe005e001000ee0>The Lords are sure to gather their<0fe003e00ee0>Remnants and fight by his side.
That will finish off the Conqueror.
Dave. Something's been bugging me.
The Conqueror used Mom's tablet to change<0fe003e00ee0>the Valeria Heart into a talisman.<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>But I thought Wagram had the tablet.
How can that be?
This is the doing of one man. A man using<0fe003e00ee0>Wagram as a pawn in his twisted game.
At the same time, he manipulates<0fe003e00ee0>the Conqueror into sparking a war,<1ae0000012430fe005e001000ee0>for no other reason than to demonstrate<0fe003e00ee0>the horrors Remnants are capable of.<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>Once a world war erupts,<0fe003e00ee0>the people will no longer believe<1ae00000fa420fe005e001000ee0>the Lords fit to control the Remnants.
If the descendant of Marion Marshall were<0fe003e00ee0>to appear after all that, she would easily<1ae0000025430fe005e001000ee0>be given control of all the Remnants...<1ae000005c420fe005e001000ee0>With Irina by his side, he'll reign as<0fe003e00ee0>the new God Emperor.
By he you mean...?
The Chairman of the Congress<07f00fe003e00ee0>Duke Wilfred Hermeien.
It all makes sense now.
Lord David, I know this is a selfish request<0fe003e00ee0>to make at a time like this.<1ae0000034430fe005e001000ee0>But you must save my daughter!
I have already promised Rush that Irina<0fe003e00ee0>will not be a pawn in this war.<1ae0000017430fe005e001000ee0>Please, get up.
Thank you... Thank you so much!
Young master!
Calm down. I am alright.
Lord David.
Emma Honeywell the Second has returned to Athlum!<1ae00000f0420fe005e001000ee0>Lord David, your orders!
Serve me, as did your mother before you.
Yes, my lord!
What now, Dave?
Our true foes await us in Nagapur.<1ae0000070420fe005e001000ee0>I will take along only a few men to<0fe003e00ee0>avoid detection.<1ae000000c430fe005e001000ee0>We will attack when the time is right.<0fe003e00ee0>We shall avenge her death!

My dear Marquis, you know as well as I<0fe003e00ee0>that Duke Hermeien would prefer if you<1ae0000020430fe005e001000ee0>bid a hasty retreat...
Your life will be in jeopardy if you don't.
Duke Hermeien can't be serious about<0fe003e00ee0>using Marion's Blessing!
My place is not to question these things.
You have been warned, Marquis.
Lord David...
We must protect Irina at all costs!<0fe003e00ee0>We cannot allow her power to be abused!

Duke Hermeien. You've manipulated both<0fe003e00ee0>the Conqueror and the Academy.<1ae000000d430fe005e001000ee0>Do you really think you can seize<0fe003e00ee0>the Remnants unchallenged?
Not by me, you won't!
You've missed my point.
I am not after the Remnants.<1ae0000082420fe005e001000ee0>I am searching for someone who can<0fe003e00ee0>control them.
It takes one with great will to operate<0fe003e00ee0>a Remnant. But it takes a great toll...
The Gae Bolg killed your father.<0fe003e00ee0>I'm sure you're one to understand.
Is that why you need Irina?
So long as I have the Marshall girl,<0fe003e00ee0>the Remnants are mine to command!
The only divine power that shall be<0fe003e00ee0>connected to them is me!
How wonderful will that be!?<0fe003e00ee0>A new era will begin!
I ask you: David Nassau, how would you<0fe003e00ee0>like to join me in ruling this<1ae0000043430fe005e001000ee0>new generation!?
The Remnants may bring suffering, but I<0fe003e00ee0>will live with it, just as my father did.
I will never accept your offer!
Wagram.
Yes, my lord.
The Marquis of Athlum wishes to die.<0fe003e00ee0>Fulfill his request!

Thus, half a year passed.<0fe003e00ee0>After taking control of the Congress,<1ae0000026430fe005e001000ee0>the newly appointed Chairman Ghor deemed<0fe003e00ee0>Lord Wilfred Hermeien a casualty of war.
The official story was that after<0fe003e00ee0>the Conqueror killed Hermeien,<1ae00000fe420fe005e001000ee0>the Conqueror's forces were destroyed<0fe003e00ee0>in the subsequent fighting.<1ae00000e6420fe005e001000ee0>Without an army to fight, the war was over.
However, the scars left from the war<0fe003e00ee0>had cut deeper than we'd thought.
Violence erupted around the world,<0fe003e00ee0>and the Lords,<1ae00000dc420fe005e001000ee0>frustrated from the abundance of futile efforts,<0fe003e00ee0>devised the ultimate plan.
The Remnants' powers were to be used to<0fe003e00ee0>suppress the violence.<1ae0000007430fe005e001000ee0>Suddenly, the Remnants meant to protect<0fe003e00ee0>the people were being used against them.
However, the Duke of Ghor did not accept this. <1ae00000b4420fe005e001000ee0>The people had placed their trust in the Congress,<03e0>he said, and it was their duty to repay that trust.
Thanks to Chairman Ghor's efforts,<0fe003e00ee0>things finally began to change.<1ae000001b430fe005e001000ee0>He declared that we had to uncover<0fe003e00ee0>new Remnants<07f0>something for the people<1ae000000c430fe005e001000ee0>to put their trust into.
The Congress spread his message to<0fe003e00ee0>the people.<1ae0000016430fe005e001000ee0>Their hearts were moved, and<0fe003e00ee0>the violence subsided.
A new age was dawning...one without<0fe003e00ee0>the horrors of war.<1ae0000028430fe005e001000ee0>At least, that's what we all believed...

You... I don't want you worrying about<0fe003e00ee0>this kind of stuff.
Rush. Go get ready.<0fe003e00ee0>I need to speak with Irina.
...Fine.
You know that Rush only wants you to<0fe003e00ee0>be safe.
I know...but...
Don't be foolish, Irina.<0fe003e00ee0>You're just a normal girl.
Me? Normal?<0fe003e00ee0>Even with that terrible power I have?
Just forget about what happened in<0fe003e00ee0>Nagapur, alright?
Nagapur...<0fe003e00ee0>How am I supposed to just forget that?
You cannot<07f0>and should not.
Terrible things are all the more necessary<0fe003e00ee0>to remember. You can end this nonsense.
What're you doing here?
Even if you knew, you could not prevent me<0fe003e00ee0>from reaching my goal.<1ae0000021430fe005e001000ee0>That is because I...

I'm certain Irina would appreciate it<0fe003e00ee0>if you got her something.<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>In matters of the heart,<0fe003e00ee0>actions speak louder than words, you know.

So, the "Blessed Buns" are out?
You really think she's interested in buns?
Umm...
You're back surprisingly early, my lord.
Not to speak ill of the dead, but without<0fe003e00ee0>Hermeien, things move a bit more smoothly.
Congress Chairman Ghor has given Athlum its orders.<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>We are to stop The Conqueror at any cost.
This's about some Remnant-finding...resonance...<0fe003e00ee0>oscillating wave...thingamajigger...?
Hmmm! This was a top-secret project of<0fe003e00ee0>the Academy's, was it not?
Remnants emit a wave undetectable by<0fe003e00ee0>the naked ear. However, there is a Remnant<1ae0000010430fe005e001000ee0>that can sense these waves and use them<0fe003e00ee0>to pinpoint a Remnant's location.
...So?
The Conqueror clearly aims to take possession<0fe003e00ee0>of every Remnant in the world.<1ae000000e430fe005e001000ee0>Our task is to get there and<0fe003e00ee0>protect them before he can.
I see... That's why this information<0fe003e00ee0>was declassified.
Pretty important mission...
Yes. We'll have to keep our wits about us.<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee01ae000002041>Rush.
I'd like to ask your parents' assistance<0fe003e00ee0>with this. Will that be a problem?
Uh-uh. I'm sure Mom and Dad would be<0fe003e00ee0>happy to help.
Then we'll return to Athlum immediately.<0fe003e00ee0>Get ready to move out.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, my lord.

What's going on?
It looks like the tracking Remnant has<0fe003e00ee0>already arrived.
So this is the Remnant...<0fe003e00ee0>When will we be able to put it to use?
Right away.
I assume the lights represent the general<0fe003e00ee0>locations of Remnants.
Yes. Right now, it's set to search only<0fe003e00ee0>the Athlum area.
This light, here, must be the Gae Bolg.
That would be the case.
With a little more time, we can expand<0fe003e00ee0>the detection range to the entire world.<1ae0000020430fe005e001000ee0>We can't pinpoint the exact location of<0fe003e00ee0>each Remnant,<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>but we can get a general idea of where they're located.
You have done more than enough.<0fe003e00ee0>I am grateful for your assistance in this matter.
It's my pleasure. Although we'll need a little<0fe003e00ee0>more time to work out the kinks.
About what you mentioned earlier...<1ae0000064420fe005e001000ee0>I think we can specify the range<0fe003e00ee0>if we change this thing here...
Hey, Sis. Didn't expect to find you here.
I heard they needed all the help they can get,<0fe003e00ee0>so I decided to make myself useful.
Don't be stupid.<0fe003e00ee0>Just stay away from Remnants, okay?<1ae00000a6420fe005e001000ee0>You're like a danger-magnet when you're<0fe003e00ee0>near them!
But there's a reason I'm doing this.<0fe003e00ee0>You have to trust me, Rush.
You don't know what I went through when<0fe003e00ee0>you were gone.<1ae000008c420fe005e001000ee0>I can't go through that again!<0fe003e00ee0>I won't!
Rush, calm down.
Hey!

Years ago, when I was just a kid...<1ae0000096420fe005e001000ee0>Mom and Dad suddenly decided to go to<0fe003e00ee0>the Academy and left me in charge of Irina.
After they left... I took her to the woods<0fe003e00ee0>nearby and left her there.<1ae0000016430fe005e001000ee0>I told her I'd come back for her later.<0fe003e00ee0>She was always their favorite.<1ae00000f0420fe005e001000ee0>I guess I was kinda jealous.
I just wanted to scare her a little. It wasn't<0fe003e00ee0>far from the house, so I figured she'd come<1ae0000009430fe005e001000ee0>back on her own sooner or later.
I was wrong.<1ae0000020420fe005e001000ee0>And when it started to get dark outside,<0fe003e00ee0>I got worried and ran back to get her.
She was still in the exact same spot I'd<0fe003e00ee0>left her in, just staring at some flowers.<1ae0000046430fe005e001000ee0>She was waiting for me to come back, all alone<0fe003e00ee0>in the dark. She didn't doubt me at all.
That's when I realized something.<0fe003e00ee0>I had to protect her.<1ae0000010430fe005e001000ee0>I decided never to betray her again.
You better not mention this to her.
She's not a child anymore.<0fe003e00ee0>You mustn't act like a baby-sitter.
Oh, yeah?<0fe003e00ee0>Well, how am I supposed to act, then?
You must treat her with respect, as a fellow<0fe003e00ee0>adult. Let her know she can count on you.
Respect, huh? Sounds...deep.

I bring a message from Chairman Ghor.
The session of Congress will commence immediately.
That's it?
This is nothing unusual. They always seem<0fe003e00ee0>to be held on the spur of the moment.
Will you be heading to Elysion? If that's<0fe003e00ee0>the case, could we send someone with you?<1ae0000001430fe005e001000ee0>I want to report our progress to the Academy.
Very well. Who shall it be?
Let's see... Who should I send?
I have an idea!
If you don't have anyone in mind...<0fe003e00ee0>How about sending Irina?
Irina's been through a lot.<1ae0000070420fe005e001000ee0>I think she's proved she can handle<0fe003e00ee0>something important like this.
Sounds like a plan. If it's alright with her.
Irina? What do you say?
Yes! Of course I'll go!
Thanks, big brother!

So it's impossible to track all existing Remnants...
For the moment, yes.<1ae0000070420fe005e001000ee0>But if we adjust this, right here,<0fe003e00ee0>I think we can increase the accuracy...
This way, we might be able to find Remnants<0fe003e00ee0>that no one else has discovered yet.
You may be on to something...<0fe003e00ee0>It's definitely worth a try.
Great!
She's a bright young lady.
Is wittle Rush in a bad mood?
You miss having her need you, don't you?
Whatever.
Who knows what Remnants could be hiding<0fe003e00ee0>under our noses?<1ae00000ce420fe005e001000ee0>They can look like anything<07f0>maybe even<0fe003e00ee0>a mitra.
You have quite an imagination!
The meeting over already?
It was canceled. The lords of Melphina,<0fe003e00ee0>Balterossa, Royotia, and Celapaleis...<1ae0000048430fe005e001000ee0>None were present.
This cannot be a coincidence.
We have been asked to find out where<0fe003e00ee0>they are and why.
The Duke of Ghor sure is a slave-driver.
We must leave immediately.<0fe003e00ee0>As for you, Miss Irina...
I'll go too!
But, that... Well...
Mr. David, I beg of you. There has to be<0fe003e00ee0>something I can do to help.
And...I don't want to be scared of<0fe003e00ee0>my power for the rest of my life.
Alright. You may accompany us.<0fe003e00ee0>Emmy, I place you in charge of her.<1ae0000052430fe005e001000ee0>Teach her a few things about self-defense.

I feel some kind of power flowing into him.<0fe003e00ee0>It feels like... Almost like a Remnant?
What? I don't understand. How can that be?
This must be part of someone's plan.
This power he's sent, it's eating away at me<0fe003e00ee0>from within...trying to control me.<1ae0000087430fe005e001000ee0>And through it, I can feel him...
David. Can't you feel it?
Thank you.
We must head to Ghor Castle and report<0fe003e00ee0>our findings to the Duke.
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!

So the urchin from Qubine believes<0fe003e00ee0>someone is behind this?
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
Well... I must admit that he may be correct<0fe003e00ee0>in his assumption...
Who<07f0>!?
Happy to see me, Duke?
L-Lord Hermeien...?
No way...
I don't understand!
I hear you nabbed my position as chairman<0fe003e00ee0>of the Congress.<1ae0000023430fe005e001000ee0>My, my, haven't we moved up in the world?
You okay!?
This power... This is what I sensed from<0fe003e00ee0>the Duke of Qubine.
Yes, yes. This power I obtained from the Remnants<0fe003e00ee0>is nothing less than extraordinary.<1ae0000087430fe005e001000ee0>I am now what you would call "omnipotent."
I shared this power with the others but<0fe003e00ee0>they aren't reacting to it very well.<1ae0000016430fe005e001000ee0>Apparently, it's killing them instead.<0fe003e00ee0>Oh, the guilt!
You're the one behind all this? But why!?
Your ignorance never ceases to amaze me.<0fe003e00ee0>I want to rule the world! Join me, Duke!
Lord Hermeien... I...
My lord, you must step back!<0fe003e00ee0>He cannot be reasoned with!
Rush!
My dear maiden of Marshall. This is<0fe003e00ee0>divine will. We must all be released!
What?
Irina, get back!
Very well. I know when I'm not welcome.<0fe003e00ee0>However, I will return expecting a decision, Duke.<1ae0000048430fe005e001000ee0>I hope you make the right one<0fe003e00ee0>and side with me.
Oh my...
Lord David, are you hurt?
I'm fine.
I thought Lord Hermeien had perished<0fe003e00ee0>in Nagapur.
This is too weird.<0fe003e00ee0>Does anybody know what's going on!?
Chairman...what do you intend to do?
I have no reason to doubt his words.<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>Lord Hermeien will return and I must be<0fe003e00ee0>prepared for him.
Ensuring his destruction is my duty as<0fe003e00ee0>his successor.

Lord David! I'm glad I caught you.
What is it?
Take a look at this.
What are these black lights?
They appeared a few days ago.
These are Remnants as well?
Well, they should be. But they don't<0fe003e00ee0>seem to be the regular kind.<1ae0000001430fe005e001000ee0>It looks like they're draining the powers of nearby<0fe003e00ee0>Remnants, and then shooting it to a single spot.
Remnants that can steal the power of others?<0fe003e00ee0>I've never heard of such a thing.
This is news to us, too.<0fe003e00ee0>We're going to look into it ASAP.
What is this "single spot" they're<0fe003e00ee0>concentrating their powers into?
This spot in the center of all<0fe003e00ee0>the black lights. Here.
Is that...?
I believe that's Koenigsdorf. It's been<0fe003e00ee0>a valuable stronghold since ancient times.
Irina?
It...It holds the same power I felt<0fe003e00ee0>in Duke Hermeien.
He must be there, then.
Make preparations for battle.<0fe003e00ee0>We are going to launch an assault on Koenigsdorf.
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Yes, my lord!
Oh, yes.
The Duke of Ghor need not know<0fe003e00ee0>about this. Who knows what he'll do...
I have a favor to ask you both.<1ae0000070420fe005e001000ee0>If possible, I would like Irina to<0fe003e00ee0>accompany us a little longer.
I have a feeling she is going to be of<0fe003e00ee0>great help to us.
I understand if you're concerned for<0fe003e00ee0>her well-being.<1ae00000be420fe005e001000ee0>I will not force her to come.
Irina is a grownup.<0fe003e00ee0>She can make her own decisions.

Ohh, my poor, poor subordinates.<0fe003e00ee0>Certainly, they were far too incompetent<1ae0000056430fe005e001000ee0>to stop you, but at least they showed me<0fe003e00ee0>a magnificent death.

The flow of Remnant power doesn't feel<0fe003e00ee0>so strong anymore.
Are you sure?
I'm positive. The barrier around Koenigsdorf<0fe003e00ee0>seems weaker than before.
Then, that was one of those lights?<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>That fiend we just defeated was sapping power<0fe003e00ee0>from other Remnants and sending it to Koenigsdorf?
Yes, I think so.
That can't be! Are you saying that was<0fe003e00ee0>a Remnant?
I don't know about that...
Guys, who cares what they are?<0fe003e00ee0>We know we've gotta beat them all to get<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>into Koenigsdorf, right?<0fe003e00ee0>Let's deal with the questions later!

We got 'em all.
The flow of Remnant power has stopped.
Alright. Now we can finally enter Koenigsdorf.
What's going on?
Please, stop!
The Gae Bolg is...trying to free itself!
I can't control it!

Don't tell me you were behind what just<0fe003e00ee0>happened!
You certainly do enjoy throwing around<0fe003e00ee0>accusations...
The Conqueror<07f0>what does he want?<0fe003e00ee0>What's he planning to do?
Why do you ask questions you already<0fe003e00ee0>know the answers to?
What do you mean?
Or are you simply choosing not to see<0fe003e00ee0>the truth?
You're scared, aren't you?
No, I'm not!

We've returned, my lord.
How is the chairman?
It is still too close to call.
I see.
What is this!?
What's going on, Dad?
Hey, that light's moving.
Huh?
Argh...we've lost it.
What even was it?
If it showed up on this baby,<0fe003e00ee0>it was a Remnant, of course!
Irina?
Don't! Irina!

That light is back.
Where's it at?
Hmm...Darken Forest, I'd say.
So, this glowing light is the Conqueror?<1ae0000096420fe005e001000ee0>How come he's on the Remnant tracker thing?
It must be the talismans he carries.
Well, Dave?
Lord David, what shall we do?
We were unable to protect Duke Ghor.
We are powerless in the face of the Conqueror.<1ae00000ba420fe005e001000ee0>That's how it was at Nagapur,<0fe003e00ee0>that's how it was at Koenigsdorf.

She wasn't to be mixed up in any of this.<0fe003e00ee0>I gave my word...
Hey, this isn't your fault, Dave.<0fe003e00ee0>Irina did all this because she wanted to.
Rush!
Mom?
Irina... Irina's gone!
By the time you get this, I'll be in Darken Forest.<0fe003e00ee0>There's something I need to find out.
Please, don't worry about me<07f0>I'll be fine.<0fe003e00ee0>If things get too scary, I'll come right back, okay?
How...how could she do such a foolish thing...
People can't choose how they're born.<1ae00000c8420fe005e001000ee0>Coming into the world with Marion's Blessing<0fe003e00ee0>isn't a mandate to use it.
Geez... She's always taking things<0fe003e00ee0>so seriously.
Dave! I'm gonna go save Irina.
I know that I can't really do much against <0fe003e00ee0>the Conqueror...<1ae00000b4420fe005e001000ee0>But I've left Irina behind before.<0fe003e00ee0>I'm not gonna do it again!

However!
I cannot allow you to go alone.<0fe003e00ee0>I'm coming with you.

That's great news.
Lord David.
Yes, I realize we must come to a decision<0fe003e00ee0>regarding future actions.
You mustn't! Sir!
Lord Qubine?
Well, well. You're looking grave, as always.
To what do I owe this honor?
I'll make this quick.
I need someone to pay a visit to the God Emperor.<0fe003e00ee0>I've appointed you, David.
The God Emperor? But why?
The Conqueror's powers were bestowed by<0fe003e00ee0>the God Emperor himself.<1ae0000015430fe005e001000ee0>It is your task to go and ask His Highness<0fe003e00ee0>everything he knows.
That is a great responsibility.<1ae00000ae420fe005e001000ee0>A man of my meager stature should not even<0fe003e00ee0>be in the same room as the God Emperor.
Hm? So, you're saying the acting chairman<0fe003e00ee0>of the Congress is not allowed an audience<1ae000003c430fe005e001000ee0>with His Highness?
What is this?<0fe003e00ee0>I've been chosen as acting chairman?
It was something the ever-withering Ghor<0fe003e00ee0>and I decided.<1ae0000002430fe005e001000ee0>Of course, this arrangement is only until he recovers.
But not to worry<07f0>this is purely based on<0fe003e00ee0>your accomplishments.<1ae0000015430fe005e001000ee0>There are no strings attached.
I-I see...
Now that you're up to date,<0fe003e00ee0>I want you to leave immediately.
Oh, David. There's just one more thing...
Hereafter you do not need my authorization<0fe003e00ee0>for anything,<1ae000000c430fe005e001000ee0>including the use of the Gae Bolg.<0fe003e00ee0>I'll leave matters in your hands.
Are you saying...?
A little slow today, are we?<1ae0000082420fe005e001000ee0>I'm saying Athlum is now an independent state,<0fe003e00ee0>no longer under the reign of Celapaleis.
Lord David!
Young master!
Way to go, Dave!
Lord Qubine... I can't thank you enough...
David...er, I mean, Lord David of Athlum.<0fe003e00ee01ae000003c430fe005e001000ee0>Know this: Making your own decisions...<0fe003e00ee0>is hardly an easy task.
I thank you for your concern. However,<0fe003e00ee0>I will not have to do this alone.<1ae000000f430fe005e001000ee0>I am surrounded by people I can count on<07f00fe003e00ee0>people I trust.

I come as acting chairman of the Congress:<0fe003e00ee0>Marquis David Nassau of Athlum.<1ae000001b430fe005e001000ee0>I am honored to be here in Your Excellency's<0fe003e00ee0>presence.
Today is truly a memorable day for the people<0fe003e00ee0>of Athlum, as there is no greater glory than<1ae00000f0420fe005e001000ee0>receiving the opportunity for an audience<0fe003e00ee0>with Your Excellency...
Enough.
Your Excellency?
Enough empty formalities, Marquis.<0fe003e00ee0>They are ever so impersonal.
Peasant or vassal, we treat all as equals.<0fe003e00ee0>Such deference is unnecessary.
Would you not agree?
Whatever pleases His Excellency.
What a weirdo.
Marquis of Athlum.<1ae000007c420fe005e001000ee0>We have heard of your many achievements.<0fe003e00ee0>To accomplish so much at such a young age<1ae0000034430fe005e001000ee0>is quite impressive. Surely your father<0fe003e00ee0>looks down on you with pride.
Oh, er... You are too kind.
Your Excellency! I come bearing a question.
Concerns about the Conqueror?
Tis a tricky topic. Though we would like nothing more<0fe003e00ee0>than to satisfy your desire for enlightenment...
The Conqueror's actions are destroying the world's<0fe003e00ee0>balance. Without question, he must be stopped!<1ae0000034430fe005e001000ee0>Please, you must tell us what you know!
Destroying the balance of the world,<0fe003e00ee0>you say? A frightening man indeed.
Your Excellency! Were you not the one who<0fe003e00ee0>bestowed power upon this man?<1ae00000f0420fe005e001000ee0>What were your intentions?
But a mere child you are, Marquis. <0fe003e00ee0>You see naught but what's before your face.
You are Irina Sykes?
Y-yes!
Then, you are she who bears the blood of Marshall?<1ae00000f2420fe005e001000ee0>The Lady Marion's beauty lies within.
Marquis. In deference to the blood of our ancient<0fe003e00ee0>consort, the Conqueror's secrets we will reveal.
However...
Make certain you have the courage to proceed!

Someone's here.
Wagram!
Lord Wagram.
It has been far too long.
Wagram... What exactly are you scheming?
Your eyes hold such suspicion! I am merely<0fe003e00ee0>doing what the Remnants desire of us.
What are you talking about?
Before man so much as crawled upon the earth,<0fe003e00ee0>Remnants existed, maintaining balance and harmony.
Remnants were treated as divine creations<0fe003e00ee0>by man<07f0>both feared and worshipped.<1ae0000061430fe005e001000ee0>However, all changed with the birth of<0fe003e00ee0>one who could control them all.
As time passed, men grew more and more audacious,<1ae000000e430fe005e001000ee0>treating Remnants as nothing more than<0fe003e00ee0>beneficial tools.
So foolish are men.
Once again, men must fear Remnants' power...<0fe003e00ee0>they must worship their strength.<1ae0000039430fe005e001000ee0>That is the only role of such unworthy creatures.
Now, with the coming of a Remnant that <0fe003e00ee0>can express his desires,<1ae000000c430fe005e001000ee0>we must listen, obey,<0fe003e00ee0>and accept all he has to say.
...Whatever the cost.
You say there is a Remnant that can express<0fe003e00ee0>his intentions...his desires?
You mean the Conqueror, right?
Preposterous...<1ae00000e0410fe005e001000ee0>-Th-that's impossible!<0fe003e00ee0>-That can't be...
Th-that's impossible!
That can't be...
Indeed. This was his home before he awakened.
Heed my words: You will leave the Conqueror be.<1ae0000025430fe005e001000ee0>That is, if you value your lives.
Wait! What if the Conqueror's planning something<0fe003e00ee0>horrible, like taking over the entire world?
You're saying you want us to just sit back<0fe003e00ee0>and watch it happen?
Weren't you listening, my boy?<1ae0000082420fe005e001000ee0>I said whatever the cost.
Your Excellency...<0fe003e00ee0>You can't feel the same way...
The line of God Emperors is due to the Remnants.<1ae00000f0420fe005e001000ee0>Who are we to stand in the way<0fe003e00ee0>of the Conqueror's wishes?
Hear this, Marquis of Athlum.<0fe003e00ee0>Hereafter, no one shall hinder the Conqueror.<1ae000002a430fe005e001000ee0>Any who go against his goals shall be branded<0fe003e00ee0>a traitor.
Go and inform the Congress at once.<0fe003e00ee0>You will abide by our command, Marquis.

To Elysion, sir!
What does he want now?
He may very well be trying to seize<0fe003e00ee0>the Sacred Lands.<1ae0000010430fe005e001000ee0>However, I am at a loss as to what purpose<0fe003e00ee0>that would fulfill...
What of the other lords?
Sir! The other lords have shown no sign<0fe003e00ee0>of movement!
Although they object to the current situation,<0fe003e00ee0>none wish to be branded a traitor.
You're right... No one dares oppose<0fe003e00ee0>the God Emperor. Dammit!
Lord David.
Man, you guys are useless!<1ae0000054420fe005e001000ee0>Dave, I can go straighten things out<0fe003e00ee0>with the Conqueror if you want.
I'm not originally from Athlum, so you<0fe003e00ee0>shouldn't take any heat from what I do, right?
Please tell me you're joking.
I'm totally serious. I mean, I know<0fe003e00ee0>it won't be easy.
But I have my talisman,<0fe003e00ee0>so if I play my cards right...
This is lunacy. You must be joking.
Dave. I can't tell you how much I<0fe003e00ee0>appreciate what you've done for me.
If it weren't for you,<0fe003e00ee0>Irina would probably still be kidnapped.<1ae00000ac420fe005e001000ee0>And Mom and Dad would probably<0fe003e00ee0>be in big trouble, too.
Well...
It's time I paid you back for everything<0fe003e00ee0>you've done for me.
Wait!
Sis, this time I can't take you with me.<0fe003e00ee0>Be good, okay? I'll be back.<1ae0000047430fe005e001000ee0>You know I will.
...I'm an idiot!<0fe003e00ee0>What am I doing sitting here?
Rush, you're right. If we leave the Conqueror<0fe003e00ee0>to do as he pleases, it may not matter whether<1ae0000034430fe005e001000ee0>the God Emperor considers us traitors.<0fe003e00ee0>We may be faced with a fate much worse.
Wagram may have been able to accept this,<1ae00000a0420fe005e001000ee0>but that does not mean<0fe003e00ee0>we have to sit back and do the same!
Dave...
The consequences can be dealt with later.<0fe003e00ee0>We must do whatever is necessary to protect<1ae000000e430fe005e001000ee0>our world from the forces which oppose us.
I command you as Lord David Nassau,<0fe003e00ee0>Marquis of Athlum!<1ae00000dc420fe005e001000ee0>All troops are to head to Elysion immediately!<0fe003e00ee0>We will fight the Conqueror!
If you do not wish to participate,<0fe003e00ee0>flee Athlum now.<1ae00000a0420fe005e001000ee0>Stay only if this holds purpose to you.
You really are a fool if you think anyone<0fe003e00ee0>here will abandon you at this crucial time.
Yeah! We fear nothing and nobody!
If His Excellency is to find out,<0fe003e00ee0>we can think of a cover story if need be.
Lord David! Let's go!

Yes, my lord!

You've arrived.
What's your game, Conqueror?
I desire to release Remnants from<0fe003e00ee0>the hands of men.
Release?
The beings of this planet have become far too<0fe003e00ee0>accustomed to using Remnants as their tools.
At this rate, they will push the Remnants' power<0fe003e00ee0>beyond their limits. They will destroy all existence.
Ridiculous! Do you really think so little<0fe003e00ee0>of us?
Do you really think your trust in mankind<0fe003e00ee0>is founded?
My duty is to prevent that eventuality.
Who<07f0>what really are you?
Merely one warden of the Remnants.
Warden?
So there's something here in Elysion you need<0fe003e00ee0>to "release" the Remnants<07f0>is that it?
You should know. This was not originally<0fe003e00ee0>my task to complete.
With the activation of this machine, all of<0fe003e00ee0>the world's Remnants will be freed.
While you're answering questions, maybe you can<0fe003e00ee0>answer me this: Why did you do that to Hermeien?
I desired to learn to what extent releasing<0fe003e00ee0>the Remnants would affect this world.
Thankfully, I found that Remnants merely<0fe003e00ee0>consume lesser lifeforms, like men.
People consumed by Remnants? Then...if all<0fe003e00ee0>the Remnants were released...
Well? Do you finally understand?
I understand that you don't really<0fe003e00ee0>give a damn about people's lives.
But me... My friends and family are<0fe003e00ee0>something I wouldn't trade for the world.<1ae00000f0420fe005e001000ee01ae00000f0410fe005e001000ee0>I'll protect them, no matter what.
As you wish. I won't hold back.<1ae00000b8420fe005e001001ae00000d24205e001000ee0>Come.

I can do this!

To be someone else's weapon? A tool?<1ae00000b4420fe005e001000ee0>So long as you leave them unchecked,<0fe003e00ee0>that's all you are, Marshall!

But...it's not like I can just let this happen!
You've all done so much for me...<0fe003e00ee0>I can't let you die! I won't!
Dave...sorry! I don't think you're gonna<0fe003e00ee0>have any Remnants left after this...
But...it'll be okay! People will figure out<0fe003e00ee0>how to live without us!
Right. It'll be alright, Rush! I...<0fe003e00ee0>We'll get by somehow!
Rush!
No!!!

Listen up, Rush.<03e0>You can have the upper hand if you initiate battles<03e0>instead of being ambushed.
Yeah, I know.
And it's always good to fight as many monsters as<03e0>possible at the same time.
Why? That sounds dangerous.
The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward, that's what<03e0>I say!
What do you mean?

Who are you and why are you here?<03e0>This is the warrior town of Ghor.<04e0>Many brave soldiers are gathered here, sworn to follow<03e0>the valiant Duke of Ghor.<04e0>You hail from Athlum!? That must mean you take orders<03e0>from that toddler, Duke Qubine.<04e0>If you have no business here, I suggest you leave<03e0>immediately.

Ever since the Duke of Ghor became Chairman,<03e0>the warrior town has been bustling!<04e0>Our lord can guide even the most lost souls of this<03e0>chaotic world down the right path.<04e0>As a citizen of this town, I want to do my part to<03e0>help out in any way I can.
Damn the Conqueror!<04e0>Do you know how many times I've stopped myself<03e0>from taking the boys with me into his base and<03e0>slaughtering them all? Argh!<04e0>But I need to stay calm, especially while the lord<03e0>is out of commission.<04e0>Right now, he's resting and needs to concentrate<03e0>on getting better.<04e0>In the meantime, I can't allow any suspicious<03e0>persons into this town!
The lords of Ghor have been faithful servants to<03e0>the Hermeiens of Nagapur for the past three<03e0>generations.<04e0>If anyone seriously tries to oppose Nagapur, the Ghor<03e0>troops will relentlessly set them straight.<04e0>...Don't tell anyone this, but I think our lord is much<03e0>more competent than Lord Hermeien.

I can't believe the lord of such a small town is now<03e0>the Chairman of the Congress!<04e0>I guess anything can happen.<04e0>Or maybe all the other cities have come to realize<03e0>the greatness that is our lord! Hahaha!
A long time ago, I challenged the Duke of Ghor for<03e0>the position of lord over this stronghold.<04e0>The duel was over in the blink of an eye.<04e0>But even as I was getting pummeled, I was awed to<03e0>be in the presence of one so strong.<04e0>Our lord is the most ferocious warrior in all the<03e0>lands.<04e0>He won't die easily.<03e0>He won't...!
Is this your first time here?<03e0>It's like a maze, isn't it?<04e0>This used to be nothing more than an abandoned<03e0>castle.<04e0>Ever since our lord made this place his home,<03e0>strong warriors from all corners of the world began<03e0>to show up.<04e0>Which is how I ended up here as well.
Message 2
Being chosen as chairman of the Congress<03e0>must mean that our lord was deemed<03e0>fit by all the other lords.<04e0>Everyone's so excited!<03e0>That pub over there was even open<03e0>till dawn in celebration!<04e0>We will fight for our lord whom we<03e0>believe in from the bottom of our hearts.
Message 4
Our town doesn't possess a huge Remnant<03e0>like the other towns.<04e0>Though our lord does keep the Bilqis<03e0>at his side.<04e0>It has the power to bring out the best<03e0>in people<07f0>the powers they hold inside.<04e0>That big axe represents our lord's<03e0>presence and the power he holds.<04e0>I bet you can't find a fine weapon like<03e0>that anywhere else in the world.
Message 2
Have you been to Nagapur yet?<04e0>I've seen the aftermath of many<03e0>battles, but never have I seen anything<03e0>like what I saw there.<04e0>I'm a little worried. What if the Bilqis<03e0>were to do the same thing and cause<03e0>the same kind of destruction?<04e0>A small stronghold like this would be<03e0>destroyed in mere seconds!
Message 4
Don't you agree that there's something<03e0>suspicious underneath?
Oh, hey.<03e0>Taking off soon?<04e0>No? Then leave me alone.<03e0>But before you go...<04e0>I think there's something hidden in this<03e0>town. The castle's almost fully repaired,<03e0>but there may be something underground.<04e0>I'm getting an excavation team together<03e0>to make the discovery of a lifetime!<04e0>The Arco Iris was a miracle, but<03e0>it was our miracle and only ours...<03e0>I want to discover something bigger!<04e0>This is going to take time and money,<03e0>but I promise to help out if you need me,<03e0>if you stop pestering me during my free time!<04e0>Later!
SIGH.<03e0>When is this ever going to work out?
Do you have any jobs for me?<04e0>No?<03e0>But I need funds for my excavation team!<04e0>Pagus suggested I join a guild so<03e0>I came here...and now he doesn't<03e0>even show his face.<04e0>Even the Arco Iris legend was his<03e0>baby to begin with. I don't even know<03e0>how I got involved!<04e0>Grrr...
Grrr...<03e0>No progress...
Hey, Rush, good timing!<03e0>I was just looking for you.<04e0>I've been frustrated that my plan to<03e0>create an excavation team wasn't working<03e0>out, so I came up with a different plan.<04e0>You guys should be part of the team!<03e0>I'll pay you for your troubles, I promise.<04e0>The area underneath Ghor Castle<03e0>is really fishy... There's something there,<03e0>I know it!<04e0>I'll persuade Duke Ghor to let us<03e0>investigate the area. So come on,<03e0>help me out!
You guys should join my excavation<03e0>team! I'll ask Duke Ghor for permission<03e0>to dig on his premises. What do you say?
Hey, Rush...<04e0>I couldn't get permission from Duke Ghor...<03e0>He glared at me and I froze...<04e0>...<04e0>Alright, time to come up with another<03e0>spot for excavation! There's a ton<03e0>of ruins in this world.<04e0>I'm not giving up that easily! In rough times<03e0>like these, you need something to keep<03e0>yourself occupied. I'm giving people hope!<04e0>So, c'mon!<03e0>Let's go make the discovery of a lifetime!
Rush! Are you ready yet!?<03e0>Let's go make the discovery of a lifetime!
Huh?<03e0>Maddox is wanted by the Celapaleian<03e0>army?<04e0>Like I'd believe that!<03e0>He's a nice fella, but a paranoid<03e0>old man.<04e0>I mean, think about it.<03e0>If that were true, wouldn't<03e0>Athlum be after him as well?<04e0>What a crazy old coot!

Could it be...?<03e0>Uh, nothing. It's not important.
The soldiers here are the toughest<03e0>warriors from the warrior town.<04e0>If you want their help, you better<03e0>show some respect.
Th-thank the God Emperor you're alright.<03e0>And for you to come all this way...

Hey there!<03e0>The Den of Heroes here to serve you!
Hey there! The Den of Heroes here to<03e0>serve you! I'm out of peanuts, so<03e0>how about a story instead?<04e0>South of the desert lies Royotia,<03e0>a city in a dangerous mountainous region.<04e0>Even though it's a small town, the people<03e0>who struggle to live there<07f0>their hardship<07f003e0>is burned into my memory forever.
You know why the gang in Nagapur can<03e0>rest easy?<03e0>It's because of us!<04e0>I don't think they see that.<03e0>I feel like they take us for granted!
What a thing to happen to Nagapur...<03e0>I can't help but feel sorry for them.
I thought Hermeien died during the incident<03e0>with the Gwayn, but I hear he's still alive<03e0>and crazier than ever.<04e0>I hope our lord doesn't feel like he<03e0>has to go head to head with that madman...
Hey, no shenanigans in my pub, you hear?<04e0>Our lord is recuperating at the moment.<03e0>We pray for a quick recovery.<04e0>I don't want to answer to some kid from Celapaleis!
Our lord is too noble for his own good.<04e0>Just because he feels indebted to Lord Oswald,<03e0>the previous Nagapur leader, he shouldn't feel<03e0>he has to repay his gratitude to that punk Wilfred.
A whippersnapper like Wilfred Hermeien had no<03e0>business being Chairman of the Congress in the first<03e0>place.<04e0>A fine, upstanding man with a strong sense of duty<03e0>like our own Lord Ghor is infinitely more suited for<03e0>the position.
I don't feel we owe anything to that Hermeien kid.<04e0>I saw the look in his eyes when he came to speak<03e0>with our lord. Something wasn't quite right about him...<04e0>I wonder if Ghor is prepared to throw away its<03e0>outdated sense of duty and go against Hermeien<03e0>if the need arises...<04e0>Our lord is a good man, but sometimes he's too moral<03e0>for his own good.
Our lord is resting in his castle.<03e0>I hear he's not doing very well.<04e0>I'm filled with rage!<03e0>I want to take the Conqueror's life<03e0>with my own blade!<04e0>I know I could take him on if only I<03e0>were 50 years younger.
I spoke to the white yama and he told me<03e0>about a secret Blackdale entrance.<03e0>He held such fear in his eyes...
Sir! Nothing new to report, sir!
How many times do I have to tell<03e0>you, this isn't the army!?
Sir! Sorry, sir!
The wife of Celapaleis's Baron Nielsen has<03e0>run off, sir! They're famous for fighting like<03e0>cats and dogs, so no surprise there, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Don't chase those who flee.
Wise advice, sir!
According to my sources, some crazy woman<03e0>is plotting to assassinate Duke Qubine, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?

Sir! What do you think of this?
The blame lies in politics.
According to my sources, in a certain moor,<03e0>the Imperator used his powers to seal<03e0>the entranceway to another realm, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
I smell adventure!
Any Forest Maiden that vows eternity<03e0>with a Melphinian knight gains the power of<03e0>seeing and hearing whatever her partner does, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
If I had that power, I could get into<03e0>the minds of the customers and bring<03e0>them their order without asking!
That would be genius, sir!
It seems something happened to the Last<03e0>Leaf in Crookfen, sir! The Forest Maidens and<03e0>the knights of Melphina are taking action.
Sir! What do you think of this?
I smell even more adventure!
According to my sources, this year's Kosmosfest<03e0>hasn't began yet because the Cosmos Maiden<03e0>has yet to arrive, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
A festival calls for a celebration.
Roger that, sir!
The Cosmos Maiden has made it safely to the festival<03e0>and it's about to begin, sir! It's a shame this tranquil<03e0>event is always disrupted by monsters.
Sir! What do you think of this?
A tranquil festival? Count me out.<03e0>I want some fun!
A old-fashioned woman is seeking a bodyguard,<03e0>sir! She awaits in the pub in the town with<03e0>the canals.
Sir! What do you think of this?
I've never been one to shy away from<03e0>a damsel in distress...
I'll look after the store for you, sir!

Of course, we can save ourselves.<03e0>The world will come to an end only when<03e0>we all stop having hopes and dreams!
A man with amnesia is searching for<03e0>something he lost in the desert, sir!<03e0>Perhaps he's searching for his memory?

Men are always on a journey to find<03e0>who they really are.
A notorious bandit has been seen<03e0>lurking around Athlum, sir! It seems he's<03e0>waiting for someone.
Sir! What do you think of this?
Something happened in his past to<03e0>change him into what he is today.<03e0>I can tell.
Someone is searching for the statue in<03e0>the Robelia Ruins that supposedly lets one<03e0>reunite with someone far away, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
I would go visit that person directly,<03e0>no matter how far they were.
There was a murder in the big city and<03e0>the assailant is still on the loose, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
They need to search every corner<03e0>of the city and find this man!
A large yama is in need of help, searching for<03e0>something he's lost, sir! There's something odd<03e0>about his behavior...

A white qsiti has been seen rummaging<03e0>through books written about magick, sir!<03e0>Some say he looks familiar.
Sir! What do you think of this?
Familiar, huh? I wonder if he's someone<03e0>famous...
Rumor's been going around about these<03e0>skilled mercenaries<07f0>they're twins<03e0>and they're girls, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?

Someone is hosting a game out in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea, sir! I wonder how<03e0>many people are up to the task.
Sir! What do you think of this?
I'm intrigued. I've never backed down<03e0>from a challenge.
I'll hold this place down, sir!
An old warrior is crossing the Great Sand Sea,<03e0>looking for a certain sword, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
I'd like to have a drink with this man!<03e0>It seems we'd have a lot to talk about.
The soldiers of this town all look up to their lord, sir!<03e0>He has the respect of each and every one of them.

The Honeywell clan serves Athlum well, sir!<03e0>The residents of Athlum have nothing<03e0>but trust and respect for that family.

The Honeywells are nothing compared<03e0>to our Duke Ghor.
Apparently, Torgal of the Athlum generals<03e0>is touchy about his past, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
I don't care about people's pasts.<03e0>If it doesn't come straight from their<03e0>mouths, it's usually false information anyway.
The Tournament of Heroes is starting up again, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
I heard some blue yama is looking<03e0>for a partner to enter this competition.

Sir! What do you think of this?
I have more respect for carpenters.<03e0>They're useful in the real world!
Athlum's had its share of bad luck, sir!<03e0>Hopefully, the new Honeywell girl will be<03e0>able to fill her mother's shoes.
Sir! What do you think of this?
You can't judge people by their age.
According to my sources, the admirers of<03e0>the Marquis of Athlum cannot believe there<03e0>is no woman in his life, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Why would I care about this?
The ex-director of the Academy<03e0>has been spotted at pubs in various<03e0>cities, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
All I can tell you is that she hasn't<03e0>been here.
Dr. Sykes has been seen making frequent<03e0>trips to Athlum Castle lately, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
It must be tough being famous.<03e0>You can't do anything without people<03e0>talking about you behind your back.
A monster was spotted flying around<03e0>Wyrmskeep, sir! The people are apparently<03e0>all shaken up.
Sir! What do you think of this?
Move out of the way!<03e0>I can take that sucker down!
I'll hold down the fort, sir!
A bloodthirsty female warrior is trying to hunt down<03e0>the goons responsible for the incident<03e0>at the moor, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Ah, youth.
A mob of ferocious monsters has<03e0>been spotted in the Great Sand Sea, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Ferocious? Overwhelming?<03e0>Let me at them!<03e0>I love a good fight.
Archaeologists say that in the depths of<03e0>the volcano, there is enough power to destroy<03e0>an entire city, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Volcanoes represent the explosive<03e0>energy and heat of a man chasing<03e0>his dream!
I couldn't have said it better myself, sir!
There are no means to research the dangers<03e0>that lie within a volcano, sir. But lords have their ways<03e0>of finding things out<07f0>no matter how impossible.
Sir! What do you think of this?
Volcanoes and danger!<03e0>My two favorite things in the world!
I couldn't have said it better myself, sir!
There's a town somewhere without a lord, sir!<03e0>I hear his two sons are fighting for<03e0>the position.
Sir! What do you think of this?
Fighting over power is useless.<03e0>Those who are destined to rule over others<03e0>will naturally come to power.
I couldn't have said it better myself, sir!
According to my sources, if you listen closely,<03e0>you can hear crying coming from the depths of<03e0>the Great Sand Sea, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
I-I'm not good at dealing with<03e0>anything supernatural...
Long ago, a hero wandered the Great Sand Sea, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
He's a man of the past.<03e0>Now Duke Ghor is the hero of the times.
I couldn't have said it better myself, sir!
Someone claims that if you talk to the pillar<03e0>in the Great Sand Sea, ghosts appear from nowhere, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
I-I hate ghosts!
There's a scientist in Melphina who everyone<03e0>avoids because he's absolutely crazy, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
I wonder what happened.
I think he did something horrible<03e0>to someone, sir!
Desert bugs keep flying into the pub of a town<03e0>near the desert, sir, and it's driving the owner<03e0>crazy!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Swallowing a bug or two won't kill<03e0>anyone!
You're absolutely right, sir!
Nagapur's become such a dangerous area since<03e0>the incident, sir! There's lots of crime, especially<03e0>involving the kidnapping of young boys and girls.
Sir! What do you think of this?
I've got a knuckle sandwich for<03e0>anyone who tries to hurt kids<03e0>around here!
You tell them, sir!
A trend started in Royotia, where people would<03e0>exchange treasures they found on their adventures, sir.<03e0>No one does that anymore, though.
Sir! What do you think of this?
This place is my treasure.<03e0>I wouldn't give it up for all the money<03e0>in the world.
Balterossa is the sole buyer of all of<03e0>Royotia's trade goods, sir, and there are lots of<03e0>merchants that aren't happy with the situation.
Sir! What do you think of this?
They might be disgruntled, but safety<03e0>should come first. It's better in the long run.
A yamaan mercenary is seeking help, sir!<03e0>I bet he found himself a job too big to<03e0>handle alone.
Sir! What do you think of this?
A mercenary looking for help, huh?<03e0>This must be some job!
I expect so, sir!
There's a man in Celapaleis who's sweet<03e0>one second, but angry the next, sir.<03e0>And apparently, women like that in a man!
Sir! What do you think of this?
He sounds like a kook to me.<03e0>I'll never understand women and<03e0>their taste in men.
There's a qsiti who stands in the middle<03e0>of busy streets and glares at anyone<03e0>who bumps into him, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Take me to him.<03e0>If it's confrontation he wants, it's<03e0>confrontation he'll get!
There's a mysterious woman with what looks like<03e0>the weight of the world on her shoulders, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Maybe I should give it a shot...
A group of Bloody Alice soldiers was spotted<03e0>at the moor, sir!<03e0>They must be getting ready to do something big.
Sir! What do you think of this?
They're hiding something.<03e0>I know it. What could it be?
The Jhana are now causing trouble in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea, sir! Apparently, not even<03e0>the Gae Bolg can teach them a lesson.
Sir! What do you think of this?
I admire the Silver Falcons for sticking<03e0>to their guns and doing what they believe<03e0>in, though they scare me a little, to be honest...
According to my sources, the Silver Falcons are going<03e0>to rid the area of the Jhana, sir!
Sir! What do you think of this?
We should let the Silver Falcons be,<03e0>and support their efforts from afar.<03e0>We don't want to be a burden.
According to my sources, the Silver Falcons are going<03e0>to get rid of what's left of the Conqueror's army, sir!<03e0>Good riddance!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Whatever happened to that regular<03e0>who said he was leaving to join<03e0>the Conqueror's army?
I haven't heard anything from him, sir!
A gloomy-looking man frequents the pub in Elysion,<03e0>sir, and he's scaring the customers!
Sir! What do you think of this?
Everyone has something in their past<03e0>they'd like to hide.<03e0>Some more than others.

Hmph. You're friends of the marquis.<03e0>Why have you come?
I cannot believe Lord Hermeien is still alive...<04e0>But the evil he radiates proves he is no longer human.<03e0>To think that something like this brings us to war...<04e0>Hmph. In the meantime, I shall have my emissaries<03e0>gather some information.
I see it has begun.<04e0>My emissaries have told me of your stance in our<03e0>current situation. They have also informed me of<03e0>something troubling.<04e0>The Third Committee was thought to have disbanded<03e0>after the incident in Nagapur, but apparently some<03e0>stragglers are trying to pick up where they left off.<04e0>As if I have the time to deal with this sort of trouble now!
With all the confusion lately, it's been increasingly<03e0>difficult to keep on top of things...<04e0>I've recently received reports of Third Committee cells<03e0>assembling in Nagapur, Elysion, and even this very<03e0>castle.<04e0>Adding to that is a report from the Academy, saying some<03e0>top-secret Remnant-related research documents have<03e0>been stolen, and possibly leaked to the black market.<04e0>If that information were to end up in the wrong hands<07f003e0>like those of the Third Committee<07f0>who knows what<03e0>trouble we'd be in for...
Remnants have powers that we mortals cannot even<03e0>begin to fathom.<04e0>If we cannot even control ourselves, how can we<03e0>presume to control them?<04e0>Humility... It is something that must not be forgotten.<03e0>...Even if you lot are the only ones who remember it.
I never thought the day would come when<03e0>we would meet again.<04e0>You have walked your path;<03e0>I have walked mine.<04e0>As for the Third Committee members, according<03e0>to my emissaries, they have acquired a relic<03e0>by the name of Leithion's Sword.<04e0>I've not heard of such a sword.<03e0>I know not what they're up to but<03e0>I must do everything I can to find out.
Who are you?<03e0>You don't look familiar...<04e0>Do you realize that you are standing in<03e0>the presence of Duke Ghor, a legendary<03e0>hero and possessor of the Bilqis!?
The Duke of Ghor is the head of<03e0>the Congress!<03e0>You must show some respect!
Why are you still here?<03e0>Don't you know that the Congress<03e0>meets in Elysion?
Lord...Hermeien... No, it can't be...
I will make the Conqueror regret<03e0>having laid a hand on Duke Ghor!
What is it?
It appears the marquis has taken<03e0>quite a liking to you.
What is it?
You are an interesting young man.<03e0>You manage to capture the hearts<03e0>of those around you with ease.
What is it?
Those who gather here all possess<03e0>that same look you hold in your eyes.<03e0>It pleases me so.
What is it?
Marion knows how long it has been since men arrived at<03e0>this castle<07f0>since this town came into being.<04e0>The people that helped make this town what it is were not<03e0>the purest of souls, but they were dauntless and<03e0>determined.<04e0>Their only goal was to make a better future.<03e0>I can see that same look in your eyes.<04e0>...<04e0>However, I see something else in your eyes... A certain<03e0>sparkle that I've seen in my own as well.<04e0>Who are you, my child?
What is it, Rush?
You want to dig beneath Ghor Castle!?<03e0>Don't be absurd.<04e0>Not too long ago, some strange qsiti was asking about the<03e0>same thing<07f0>babbling on about ruins and miracles and<03e0>other such tripe.<04e0>Either way, this is no time to be playing treasure hunter.<04e0>Dreams and imagination can be a good thing, but there is<03e0>a certain time and place for them to be indulged. You<03e0>and your little qsiti friend need to keep that in mind.
A mercenary going by the name of Gaou?<03e0>Yes, I've heard of him. He's the one they call the King.<03e0>Why?<04e0>...<04e0>I see. Interesting...<03e0>Don't fret. I will handle it.

Huh... Sounds pretty tough.<03e0>Take care of yourself, okay?
...Ahh. Thank you.
You're not as inconsiderate as I thought.
You're looking well.
Heya, Ms. Young Maiden.
Could you please not call me that?<03e0>It sounds ridiculous, to say the least.
Well, it's not like I know your name.
Oh?
...
The name's Emmy.
Nice to meet you for real, finally. I'm<07f001e00be00ae0>
Rush. Rush Sykes.<03e0>Right?
Wha<07f0>? How did you know!?
I have my ways.
Take care, Rush.
What's the purpose of my training?<03e0>Well...a lot of things. But in general,<03e0>training the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.

Hey, Rush.<04e0>What's with that angry sovani, Leucetius?<04e0>He challenged me for position of troupe leader.<04e0>I gave him a good pounding to show him what's what.<03e0>Hehe.
Hello, Rush.<04e0>I just ran into a very rude sovani.<04e0>He insisted on being the leader of our troupe, no matter<03e0>how many times we told him that we had no say in the<03e0>matter.<04e0>I had no choice but to use a means other than words<03e0>to get my point across.
What is it, Rush?<04e0>Yes, I encountered Leucetius.<03e0>He seemed distraught about something.<04e0>I humored him for a while and sent him away.<03e0>Don't worry about him.<03e0>I've taken care of everything.
Greetings.<04e0>Is it so rare to meet a yama interested<03e0>in mystic learnings?
I'm just a rookie spellcrafter now, but<03e0>I was once a notable guard.<04e0>I used to get jobs from the folks at<03e0>the Academy and even the Congress.<04e0>I did a lot of work as a security guard<03e0>for the Academy. No others could<03e0>match the amount they were offering.
I'm just a rookie spellcrafter now, but<03e0>I was once a notable guard.
One job I did for the Academy was to guard<03e0>the door of the lab where they were<03e0>conducting experiments.<04e0>Looking back, I should have realized what they<03e0>were doing was illegal and dangerous.<04e0>One day, the Remnant being used in the experiment<03e0>began emitting a light and then there was<03e0>an explosion.<04e0>I drifted in and out of consciousness for<03e0>a few days.<04e0>Luckily, I recovered soon after.<03e0>But my arms... To this day, I can<03e0>barely move them.<04e0>With my handicap, I couldn't continue my job.<03e0>No one found me necessary anymore.<03e0>Everyone started drifting away from me.
The explosion killed most of the nerves<03e0>in my arms.<03e0>I couldn't continue my job.
I'd lost the only job I knew how to do.<03e0>I had nothing. I didn't know what<03e0>the future held for me anymore.<04e0>Every day, I watched the sunset at Fornstrand,<03e0>thinking of how easy it would be to jump<03e0>in the ocean and disappear.<04e0>That's when a mitra calling herself<03e0>the festival maiden came along. She sat<03e0>down next to me and quietly listened to my story.<04e0>Then she turned to me and smiled and said,<03e0>"Why don't you try learning to use spells?"<04e0>What was she thinking? I'd relied on my brawn<03e0>to get me through everything in the past.<03e0>Someone like me couldn't use spells.<04e0>But before I could say anything, I glanced over<03e0>and caught her smile. It gave me strength and hope.<03e0>It made me feel like I could do anything.<04e0>Or maybe I just wanted to grab onto something<03e0>to get me out of this feeling of despair.
I was feeling hopeless until a mitra<03e0>calling herself the festival maiden<03e0>convinced me to try a new art<07f0>spells.
It wasn't easy, learning this new art.<03e0>Everyone who knew me laughed at me.<03e0>They thought it was hopeless.<04e0>But I didn't give up<07f0>I couldn't.<03e0>This was my last hope.<04e0>After a lot of studying, I finally got<03e0>the hang of it. I'll never forget that<03e0>feeling of using my first spell.<04e0>I've decided to become an expert<03e0>spellcrafter. It might seem like an impossible<03e0>dream, but I'm willing to try.<04e0>I want to achieve this dream and seek out<03e0>and thank the girl who gave me something<03e0>to live for.<04e0>I bet she's out there helping others at this<03e0>very moment.<03e0>I look forward to seeing her again.
Hey, Rush.<04e0>I'm going to keep journeying with you<03e0>so I can experience and learn what I<03e0>need to become an expert spellcrafter.
Yes?<03e0>What is it?
What is it?
Have you seen Lord David?<04e0>He should not be wandering around alone.<03e0>If you speak to him, let him know that<03e0>I was looking for him.
Where has he gone?
...
This town seems its usual self.<04e0>However, Lord David should never<03e0>have gone off alone.<03e0>Tell him I am looking for him.
Have you seen Lord David?
If it had been handed over to us,<03e0>we would have made great use of it.<04e0>Though who knows what Lord David<03e0>would have said to that.
Disregard what I stated before.
The Remnant Ark...<03e0>I've seen something similar to it,<03e0>but I can't recall what or where...
I can't recall...
Lord David made his choice.<04e0>I will stay by his side till death.
Feast your eyes on that Remnant.<03e0>Its beauty is mesmerizing.<04e0>What it would be like to float inside of it...<03e0>What fun it would be!
What beauty...
...
These rumors of Remnants going missing<03e0>had me worried, but it looks like<03e0>everything is alright.
Indeed.
Just like Athlum...<04e0>Will we ever see that exquisite splendor again?
I cannot believe this...
It exists somewhere in the world.
We must find it.
We will see this to the end.
Hey, Rush! Take a look at these weapons!<03e0>They're beauties!
Hrm.
Lady Emma...
Hey, Rush!<03e0>Things are still okay.<04e0>You gotta lighten up!
You gotta lighten up!
Everyone's spirits are down now that<03e0>the Remnants are gone.<03e0>Even our weapons lost their flare.
Even our weapons lost their flare.
I have no clue what's going on.<04e0>All I know is that I'll go wherever<03e0>you decide to go.
I'm ready to do this!
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>I'll bust up anyone who gets in our way!
What am I doing?<04e0>Just taking a walk.<03e0>It's impossible for me to wander the streets<03e0>of Athlum or Celapaleis alone.<04e0>Don't tell Torgal you found me.
Don't tell Torgal you found me.
The Remnants here are safe and sound.
...
Here, too...<04e0>So it is not just Athlum.
...
Do I look worried?<03e0>I'm doing the best I can not to show it...
Are we going to make it?
It's time, Rush.<04e0>Let's finish this together!
Nothing seems out of the norm here.<04e0>But there is a lot going on beneath<03e0>the surface. We should be careful.
We should be careful.
Disappearing Remnants...<03e0>How does this fit into the puzzle?<04e0>There's something I'm missing...
There's something I'm missing...
Don't just stand there, Rush.<03e0>Help us find a way to the Sacred Lands.
There has to be a way.
I will protect Lord David as she did.<03e0>I will also provide protection for you and Miss Irina.

Welcome to the guild.<03e0>How may I help you?
Have you been to Siebenbur, the cavern<03e0>to the south?<04e0>It's a popular spot for researchers,<03e0>as the plants that grow there are<03e0>of the rarest kind.<04e0>In fact, there's a scientist here that<03e0>is creating a new remedy using said plants.
Do you remember the bog you passed<03e0>on your way here?<04e0>That's Crookfen, the place where<03e0>we Forest Maidens perform rituals<03e0>of prayer for the Last Leaf.<04e0>The Order of Melphina protects us from<03e0>monster attacks while we pray.<03e0>It's all so romantic.

Welcome to the Babbling Brook.
Do you know the Forest Maiden Leticia?<03e0>She's as beautiful and delicate as a flower.<04e0>If only I could be her knight! I'd protect her for<03e0>as long as I live!<04e0>I would do anything to be able to talk to her.
I had no idea that Neo had already claimed Leticia as<03e0>his maiden...<04e0>I joined the Order with Neo and I got to know him well.<03e0>He's a brave man with decent fighting skills.<04e0>But...I'm much better-looking! And if you're talking<03e0>muscles...there's no comparison, I totally blow him<03e0>away. I just can't understand it...<04e0>...Just...just leave me alone.
You made such a valiant effort in the great battle on<03e0>the Malbourge Flatlands!<04e0>I was there, too. You really impressed me with the way<03e0>you were handling your sword.<04e0>Neo and Leticia?<03e0>Oh, I'm over that.<04e0>Watching you on the battlefield, I realized that I don't<03e0>need a woman<07f0>just being a strong warrior is<03e0>rewarding enough.<04e0>Thanks for cheering me up!
I train every day to become a great knight.<03e0>I have yet to find the maiden for me, though.<04e0>I wonder if I'll ever find her...
I was just in Cobalt Plaza, praying to the Blue Elf<03e0>for Meister Olebeag's quick recovery.<04e0>That's when I found my soul mate!<04e0>She had very beautiful eyes, filled with sincerity.<03e0>I haven't told her how I feel yet.<04e0>I hope that someday we can devote our lives to<03e0>each other and protect this town together.
With the loss of the Blue Elf, people are worried about<03e0>the town's future. I went to the guild today to see if I<03e0>could help out somehow...<04e0>That's when I found my soul mate!<04e0>She had very beautiful eyes and was absolutely radiant!<03e0>Of course, I haven't actually spoken to her yet...<04e0>But I hope that someday we can devote our lives to<03e0>each other and protect this town together.
Have you seen a white qsiti around these parts?<03e0>He was the leader and sole survivor of the brigade<03e0>that was eradicated in the Catacombs.<04e0>Lord knows where he is now.<03e0>I pray he's not up to anything foolish.
Hmph.<04e0>I have no time for you.
I hear you're the leader of this troupe.<04e0>Has it come down to this?<03e0>I, Leucetius, taking orders from a mitra child?<04e0>I volunteered only upon hearing of help needed<03e0>by Athlum's special forces.<03e0>I have no time for childish games.<04e0>I will show you who is a worthy leader, after I<03e0>"negotiate" with the generals.
I have nothing to say to you.
Th-that yama...<03e0>His strength...<04e0>...<04e0>Don't look at me like that.<03e0>I threw the match to allow him<03e0>to save face.<04e0>He's no worthy opponent of mine.<03e0>The other generals should make for<03e0>better opponents.
Leave me alone.
Th-that mitra...<03e0>Her flawless sword technique...<04e0>...<04e0>Don't look at me like that.<03e0>I threw the match.<03e0>I would never hurt a lady.<04e0>I need to go up against someone of higher<03e0>rank than the generals to get myself heard.
Go away. Now.
I-I can't stop shaking...<03e0>His intimidation is overwhelming...<04e0>...<04e0>...Rush, you know the marquis well,<03e0>don't you?<04e0>Then tell me this.<03e0>When he...his lord...glared at me, I couldn't<03e0>stop shaking.<04e0>How does a mitra who hasn't been around<03e0>for 20 years make others tremble in fear?<04e0>Is it a trait of a marquis?<03e0>Or perhaps something acquired by being<03e0>the owner of the extraordinary Gae Bolg?<04e0>...Whatever the case, Rush, I owe you<03e0>an apology. You are a worthy leader if<03e0>you can control such mighty warriors.<04e0>If you ever need a hand, don't<03e0>hesitate to ask.
Have you come to me for help?<04e0>Don't be shy.
The barkeep is my mentor.<03e0>I strive to be like him someday!

You must be the young man helping out with the crises around<03e0>town. I am Olebeag, Lord of Melphina. Speaking for all of us<03e0>here, I would like to extend my thanks.
I am Olebeag, Lord of Melphina.<03e0>Welcome.<04e0>Our town may be small and remote, but for academic<03e0>or mystic studies, there is no better place on the<03e0>continent.
I've lost control of my body of late.<04e0>It's as if some great power is trying to take<03e0>over me... It is truly an unpleasant feeling.
I have fallen ill and I need rest.<03e0>I apologize, for you have come such<03e0>a long way to get here.
Young Sykes. It is good to see you again.<04e0>You have Roberto and my gratitude for the aid<03e0>you've provided the Order.<04e0>Please, stay in our town and rest your weary bodies.
Young Sykes. It is good to see you again.<04e0>I cannot express fully enough my gratitude for<03e0>the risks you've taken for Melphina.<04e0>You are indeed the hero of this town.
The Blue Elf is our treasure.<03e0>However, nothing is of more importance than<03e0>one's life.<04e0>We shall immediately hand over the Blue Elf<03e0>to save the life of the Forest Maiden.
I am Olebeag, Lord of Melphina.<03e0>Our town may be small and remote, but we welcome you<03e0>all the same.
My health has failed me of late...<03e0>I must say, it is quite bothersome.
I am Roberto, commander of the Order of Melphina.<03e0>Seek me out if ever you are interested in joining us.
Meister Olebeag...<03e0>Was that there were a way I might ease your suffering...
Meister Olebeag!<04e0>I hate to see you in such a state! If only I could<03e0>sacrifice myself and rid you of the pain you suffer!
Master Sykes, welcome to our humble town.<04e0>Had it not been for your aid, this town may have fallen.<04e0>Would you consider joining the Order?
Meister Olebeag, I beg for your forgiveness!<03e0>To think that we of the Order were unable to<03e0>prevent this from happening...<04e0>I have never felt so powerless...
Master Sykes... If it pleases you, I would give you this key<03e0>to Siebenbur. We will have no more use for it...
Welcome, traveler.<03e0>I am Marsha, the leader of the Forest Maidens.
Meister Olebeag is in a terrible state... I'm very worried.
There's a strange power that surrounds Meister Olebeag.<03e0>It feels heavy and strange and...wrong.<04e0>Who could be behind this?
Sir Rush, I'm so glad you could come.<04e0>Thanks to you, we were able to replace the seal.<03e0>As the leader of the Forest Maidens, I extend<03e0>our gratitude.
If it weren't for you, Roberto and I might have met<03e0>our end.<04e0>You're Melphina's hero.<04e0>The girls of the Forest Maidens are giggling about how<03e0>they all want you to be the one they pledge their lives<03e0>to.
I see you have a parfumlily. Its scent<03e0>has a calming effect. It's useful for<03e0>when you're feeling troubled.
Are you worried about something?<03e0>Have you heard of the parfumlily flower?<03e0>Its smell is very relaxing.
The fiends after the Blue Elf were able to escape.<03e0>We chased them to the Numor Mines, but once there,<03e0>they skittered into the shadows like the rats they are.<04e0>Ooh, to think they roam free...
Well met, Master Sykes.<04e0>You have played a big part in helping Melphina through<03e0>exceedingly trying times. You have my eternal gratitude.
Hrm...<04e0>Oh...Master Sykes. I did not notice you there.<03e0>My apologies.<04e0>Of late, I've found myself heavily pondering the life I<03e0>have led, and questioning the choices I have made...
I have been heavily pondering my way<03e0>of life of late.
Nothing can stop the march of time. Likewise, the fact<03e0>that my body grows weaker with age is inevitable.<04e0>Soon comes the day I must pass the torch to a young<03e0>knight, so that they may lead the Order.<04e0>There are many young, promising knights in Melphina.<03e0>Even with my departure, the Order will stand strong.<03e0>Truly, there is no reason for me to hold any doubts...
The day I pass leadership of the Order of Melphina on to a<03e0>younger knight is not far off.
Master Sykes, if I may have your ear for a moment...<03e0>Have you ever questioned your existence<07f0>your<03e0>life's purpose?<04e0>From the moment I made my pledge with Marsha, I have<03e0>given my all to the Order. Everything I have done,<03e0>every action I have taken, has been to protect Melphina.<04e0>Without my knighthood, I fear I may become lost, knowing<03e0>not what to do with my life.<04e0>These thoughts haunt me endlessly of late...
Without my knighthood, I fear I may become lost...<03e0>These thoughts haunt me endlessly of late.
All my life, I have done my utmost to be a worthy leader<03e0>of the Order of Melphina, and use that position to protect<03e0>our lands from any threat.<04e0>However, meeting you has given me a second purpose.<04e0>Endless wars rage on in our world. From now on, I must<03e0>think of helping not only Melphina, but the entire<03e0>world.<04e0>Even if frailty of body leads me to give up knighthood, I<03e0>will never discard the values I have lived by. I will<03e0>continue to serve the world in whatever capacity I can.<04e0>To that end, I would be honored if you allow me to<03e0>continue to accompany your troupe.
Greetings.<04e0>Even as I give up knighthood, I will continue<03e0>to serve the world as I have been.

You look surprised.<04e0>Yes, that intimidating dragon you see is<03e0>indeed Nagapur's treasured Remnant<07f0>the Gwayn!<04e0>The grand castle in front of it is Wyrmskeep,<03e0>home of our beloved Lord Wilfred Hermeien.
The Conqueror is after all the Remnants<03e0>he can get his hands on, but we're not<03e0>going to let him get ours!<04e0>We will protect our lord and our Remnant.<03e0>Nagapur will not fall!

This is <1be0ffbe34ff>Flussbahn<1ce0>, the entrance<03e0>to the town built along the canal.<04e0>There are residential districts located under each of<03e0>the Gwayn's wings<07f01be0ffbe34ff>Nordenalm<1ce0> and <1be0ffbe34ff>Sudenalm<1ce0>.

There is no one more powerful and influential than our<03e0>lord, Wilfred Hermeien.<04e0>He is a born leader and chairman of the Congress.<04e0>Being named chairman means that he is the most<03e0>powerful and admired man on the continent.<04e0>I feel honored to be a citizen here.

Alright.<03e0>Just let me know if you change your mind.<04e0>But remember<07f0>I can only allow people who've<03e0>been granted permission to step on the boat.
The Marquis?<03e0>No, he's not back yet.<04e0>Why don't you take the time to look around town<03e0>a little more?
We can't leave town until Lord David returns.<04e0>Why don't you take a walk around, do some sightseeing?<03e0>And, by "sightseeing," I mean try to acquire as much<03e0>information as you can.<04e0>Rush, talk to Pagus and myself when you've finished.
I'm waiting for someone.<03e0>It's been three years since he's<03e0>gone south.<04e0>But I have faith that he'll return.<03e0>I'll continue to wait for him for as<03e0>long as I have to.
Huh?<03e0>What're you doing here, old lady?
Wha<07f0>excuse me?<03e0>Do I even know you?
Oh, oops.<03e0>Um, I thought you were someone else...
Hmph! Make sure you have the right<03e0>person next time!
S-sorry...
Hmph... I'll let it slide this time. Of course, that's on<03e0>the condition that there's never a second.
Calling someone "old lady" is rude and inconsiderate...<03e0>especially when they aren't old!
Hm? You again.
Uh.
You don't look happy to see me.
Uh, n-no, that's not true!<03e0>Say, ol<07f0>O beautiful young maid, what're you doing<03e0>around here?
Training.<03e0>In my family, it's a rite of passage<03e0>to travel the world.
Huh... Sounds pretty tough.<03e0>Take care of yourself, okay?
...Ahh. Thank you.
You're surprisingly...nice.
Hm, you look cheerful as ever.
Heya, Ms. Young Maiden.
...Right. So, could you please not call me that?<03e0>It sounds ridiculous, to say the least.
Well, it's not like I know your name.
Oh?
Oh.
The name's Emmy.
Nice to meet you for real, finally. I'm<07f001e00be00ae0>
Rush Sykes, call you Rush, right?
Wha!? C-can you see into my brain!?
Perhaps!<03e0>Though in this case, it's not much of a challenge.
Take care, Rush.
What's the purpose of my training?<03e0>Well...a lot of things. But in general,<03e0>training the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.

You are Rush Sykes, I presume.<03e0>I am Oswald.<04e0>Marina was right<07f0>you have her eyes, filled with<03e0>goodness and justice.<04e0>You need not worry about her. She is about, gathering<03e0>information to help you on your journey.<04e0>She was here until just a moment ago.<04e0>...<04e0>I realize it is hard to trust my words, but I know all about<03e0>you, Marina, and your sister Irina.<04e0>When the time is right, I will tell you all there is to know.
Your mother was right.<03e0>You have the same eyes, filled with goodness and justice.
Hello, Rush Sykes.<03e0>I have something to share with you.<04e0>Did you know that there is more than one way to enter<03e0>Wyrmskeep? In addition to the boat, it can be infiltrated<03e0>from the waterway beneath <1be0ffbe34ff>Sudenalm<1ce007f0>the <1be0ffbe34ff>Aqueducts<1ce0>.<04e0>Forget not this information, for it may come in handy<03e0>someday.
Hello, son.<03e0>I have something to share with you.<04e0>Did you know that there is more than one way to enter<03e0>Wyrmskeep?

There is no need for<03e0>that. Instead, remember what I've told you. It may come<03e0>in handy someday.
Marina was a bright young girl.<03e0>She learned the Remnant theory in<03e0>mere seconds.<04e0>Granted... To this day, I have doubts<03e0>as to whether that was a positive<03e0>thing...<04e0>Rush Sykes, you must save your sister.<04e0>Marina deserves to be with her family<03e0>again<07f0>with you and your sister<03e0>and your father.
You have your mother's eyes<07f003e0>filled with good and justice.
Welcome back.<04e0>Have you finished walking around town?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup, saw everything.<09e008e0010000000300>Nope, not yet.
Alright, come with me then.
Alright.<03e0>Keep at it. Come to me when you've<03e0>finished.
Are you ready to enter the <1be0ffbe34ff>Aqueducts<1ce0>?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Ready steady!<09e008e0010000000300>I need a sec.
Alright. Let's go!
This is Lord Hermeien's territory.<03e0>We must prepare ourselves for a long battle.<04e0>We'll leave as soon as we are ready.
Rush! Miss Irina is being held in the audience chamber<03e0>of Wyrmskeep!<04e0>These stairs will take us down to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Aqueducts<1ce0>, and<03e0>we can take them all the way through to the castle.<04e0>Lord David is waiting. Please hurry.
Taking the Aqueducts will allow us to enter<03e0>Wyrmskeep with minimal fighting.
An old man familiar with this town gave me directions<03e0>to the Aqueducts.<04e0>He reminds me of someone... But I can't quite put my<03e0>finger on who.
Miss Irina is right up here!<03e0>Come on, let's go bust some heads!

After the Gwayn turned the town into a fiery mess, the<03e0>survivors all fled to Nordenalm, since most of it was left<03e0>intact.<04e0>All we could do was stand and watch while our town<03e0>went up in flames...
Look at how gallant the Gwayn stands.<04e0>With that guarding our town, only a fool would think<03e0>of invading us.<04e0>...Though, my kid tends to burst into tears when he<03e0>sees it. I have to admit, it can be slightly intimidating.<04e0>That's when I tell him that our town stays safe<03e0>because of that Remnant. The Gwayn protects us<03e0>from the evil out there!
My kid asked me if there was going to be a war. He must<03e0>have heard about the Conqueror and his army.<04e0>I told him that the Gwayn will protect us, so there's<03e0>nothing to worry about. I've never seen a bigger smile<03e0>on his face.

Everyone's saying that the Gwayn went on a mindless<03e0>rampage, but I disagree.<04e0>The town would have been destroyed by the Conqueror<03e0>if the Gwayn hadn't done what it did.<04e0>I want to believe... No, I do believe that the Gwayn was<03e0>trying to protect us from them.
There's quite a large sewer beneath the town. It<03e0>connects the canals.<04e0>There have been monster sightings there of late, so<03e0>no civilians are allowed to enter that area.
The entrance to the Aqueducts?<03e0>...Oh, you mean the sewer.<03e0>It's in Sudenalm.<04e0>You're not thinking of going there, are you?<04e0>It's dark, damp, and worst of all, the smell is<03e0>horrendous! Not to mention that it's filled with<03e0>monsters!<04e0>Nothing is worth going down there.

As long as I live in this town, I'll never be able to forget<03e0>what happened.<04e0>This town is absolutely desolate now.

Never would I have dreamt that Nagapur<03e0>would end up in such a state.<04e0>If only there was something I could do<03e0>to help this town and its people.
Well? Are you finished?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure am!<09e008e0010000000300>No, not just yet.
Alright, meet me in Flussbahn.
I said to come to me when you've finished.<03e0>Not a moment sooner.
Hello, Rush.<04e0>I can't thank you enough for allowing me to join you.
I've traveled far and wide, searching<03e0>for something powerful. On my journey,<03e0>I caught word of an old legend.<04e0>Somewhere in the world exists a weapon<03e0>of extraordinary power.<04e0>With it, one can defeat even the strongest<03e0>of foes.
It is said that somewhere in the world<03e0>exists a weapon of extraordinary power.<03e0>I wonder if this is true.
Standing here, watching passers-by,<03e0>reminds me of my hometown.<04e0>The same sun shines through the blue<03e0>skies, causing shadows behind the buildings.<04e0>My town was not rich, but there was<03e0>an abundance of happiness and joy.<04e0>I wish I could go see it with my own<03e0>eyes once more...
I wish I could see it with my own<03e0>eyes once more...
When my town burned to the ground,<03e0>all I could do was stand there and<03e0>stare at what had become of it.<04e0>That image... It is not something I<03e0>will ever forget as long as I live and breathe.<04e0>I've traveled across many lands in search<03e0>of the man who caused such devastation.<04e0>He will continue to roam the world<03e0>until I get my revenge. That is when<03e0>my journey will end.
My journey will end when I get revenge<03e0>on the one responsible for causing<03e0>such devastation to my town.
Greetings.<04e0>I have been yearning for revenge,<03e0>but no more.<04e0>My memories with him, my desert<03e0>town that no longer exists<07f0>both<03e0>have become a special part of me.<04e0>Whatever happens, I will always have<03e0>them to keep me strong.<04e0>If it's no burden, I would like to<03e0>join you on your journey.<04e0>Perhaps it will allow me to find<03e0>a new goal in life.
Hello, Rush.<04e0>Everyone is kind and generous.<03e0>I am enjoying myself, something I<03e0>was not able to do for a long time.
Good morning!<04e0>Is everything alright?
I need to rest. I feel a bit dizzy...<04e0>What? Me? Lost? Of course not!<03e0>Don't be silly!
I need to rest. I feel a bit dizzy...
Maybe I worked myself too hard at Kosmosfest...<04e0>O-oh! H-hi, Rush! You don't need to worry about me.<03e0>I'll be better in no time!
Maybe I worked myself too hard at the festival...
Lately, it seems like my powers aren't as strong as<03e0>they used to be. This has never happened to me before...<03e0>I really don't get it.<04e0>During Kosmosfest, I felt my powers heighten like<03e0>never before. I could sense so many Remnants...<04e0>But once the festival ended, that super power went<03e0>with it. Maybe...maybe I used too much, so my body<03e0>needs time to recharge?<04e0>I'm really getting worried. What if this isn't temporary?<03e0>What should I do? A Cosmos Maiden needs her<03e0>powers, you know?<04e0>Maybe I should go talk to Mistress Marsha... She might<03e0>know what to do.
Lately, my powers have gotten really weak...<03e0>I don't know what to do!<03e0>Maybe I should go talk to Mistress Marsha.
Oh... This is a parfumlily, right?<03e0>It's beautiful. That's so sweet of you...<04e0>Hm? That's funny...<03e0>I feel...stronger, somehow.<03e0>Like my powers have come back...<04e0>Now that I think of it, my mother always told me<03e0>that a Maiden's powers were like waves...<04e0>Endlessly flowing from the sea to the land, and<03e0>back out to sea, the power becomes one with<03e0>the earth...<04e0>Ahh...I think I finally get it!<04e0>My power<07f0>my hopes and dreams become strength<03e0>for others... But their supportive thoughts return and<03e0>replenish my power.<04e0>Thank you so much, Rush! I feel so much better<03e0>now, and it's all due to you.
I'm all better now!<03e0>I want to keep traveling the world.<03e0>Just come looking for me if I get lost, okay?
There've been a lot of cases of kids going missing<03e0>from town lately. My niece being one of them...<04e0>I've been doing some searching of my own, but no luck.<03e0>Dammit!<04e0>I can't open up shop with this hanging over my head.
Hey, I heard you solved the kidnapping cases in town.<04e0>When my niece came back home, I hugged her so tight.<03e0>I never wanted to let her go.<04e0>With that debacle over with, I was able to open shop<03e0>again. Take a look around!

Welcome to the guild.<03e0>How may I help?
I've come all the way from Ghor Castle<03e0>with my friends. What a trek it was<03e0>over the <1be0ffbe34ff>Heroic Ramparts<1ce0>.<04e0>Have you seen it yet with your own eyes?<04e0>It's said that one of the lords of Nagapur<03e0>built that never-ending castle wall.<04e0>It's like it's representing<03e0>the never-ending flow of time.
I've traveled here with my friends<03e0>from Ghor through the Heroic Ramparts.<04e0>It's hard to believe the state of this town...
The <1be0ffbe34ff>Plain of Luhang<1ce0> that lies in front<03e0>of Nagapur is the battleground that has<03e0>protected us from invaders for ages.<04e0>This is where the legendary warrior of<03e0>Nagapur, Luhang of Zahaad, fought and beat<03e0>the entire imperial army.<04e0>Although this battle may be just a fictional<03e0>tale, the soldiers of Nagapur still talk about<03e0>him in awe.
Have you seen the Plain of Luhang lately? There isn't<03e0>a single blade of grass left, thanks to the Gwayn...<03e0>I still can hardly believe that our protector did that...

Welcome to Pub Drachenhauch!
Welcome.<04e0>Are you headed to Wyrmskeep?<03e0>You need to take the boat that leaves<03e0>the canal from Flussbahn.<04e0>I don't mean to be rude, but are you<03e0>an acquaintance of Lord Hermeien?<03e0>If not, you won't make it to the castle.<04e0>Commoners don't have a place on that boat.
Welcome.<04e0>The Aqueducts, you say?<03e0>There's an entrance in Sudenalm, but...<04e0>There've been monsters sightings in<03e0>that area lately, so they generally<03e0>keep that entrance locked.
Sir Zolean always frequents this establishment alone.<04e0>Up until three years ago, he used to come with a friend.<03e0>I wonder what became of him.
Nagapur's previous lord was Lord Oswald Hermeien.<04e0>He was a very generous and good man, but he suddenly<03e0>disappeared several years ago. Lord Wilfred claimed the<03e0>throne not long after.<04e0>It is only a rumor, but some say that he was set up<03e0>and thrown out of Wyrmskeep by Lord Wilfred.<04e0>I certainly hope that isn't the truth. There is nothing<03e0>uglier than a rivalry between parent and child.
In Sudenalm, you may encounter an old man with kind<03e0>eyes.<04e0>Rumor has it he knows a lot about Wyrmskeep<07f0>even<03e0>ways to get inside. I don't know if there's any truth to<03e0>that, though.<04e0>He really reminds me of somebody...<03e0>I just can't quite put my finger on who...
Barkeep, you've seen him, too, right?<03e0>I'm talking about the old man in Sudenalm.<04e0>He saved me when I almost fell into<03e0>the canals the other day.<04e0>That's when I realized, he reminds me<03e0>of someone... I just can't put my finger<03e0>on who it is...
Barkeep, you going to stay here and run the pub?<03e0>I'm going to leave town with my family.<04e0>But before I go, I wanted to tell you something.<04e0>That old man who looked familiar to me...<03e0>I finally figured out who he is.<03e0>He's the previous lord, Oswald Hermeien!<04e0>But I guess it doesn't matter now.
You've seen the Gwayn, yes?<04e0>I've seen many, many Remnants<03e0>in my time, but nothing is more<03e0>overwhelming than that one.<04e0>There's quite a powerful-looking one<03e0>in Balterossa, to the south, but<03e0>it can't possibly overshadow the Gwayn.<04e0>Lad, you should go to different<03e0>lands and see their Remnants with<03e0>your own eyes.
I never thought the Gwayn would<03e0>be capable of anything like this.<04e0>I thought it was the strongest<03e0>of them all.<04e0>Well, I suppose it proved its powers.<04e0>I just didn't think it would happen<03e0>like this...
I hear the Conqueror wants all the Remnants he can<03e0>get his hands on.<04e0>The major cities can protect themselves with their<03e0>armies, but what are the small towns to do?
I see a lot of black-hooded fellas<03e0>around the pub lately.<03e0>They're all so rude and obnoxious!<04e0>I mean, who brings a white jelly monster<03e0>to a pub!?<04e0>The other customers got scared and<03e0>they all up and left! And here I am,<03e0>cleaning up after it...
Many lost their lives in the Gwayn<03e0>debacle, and the pub has lost a lot<03e0>of customers, too.<04e0>And the ones who do come here<03e0>all look so solemn.<04e0>Though there is a silver lining to<03e0>what happened.<04e0>Ever since Lord Hermeien passed,<03e0>the black-hooded gang hasn't been<03e0>around.<04e0>Now this place will be a perfect spot<03e0>for those to mourn in peace.
The Duke of Ghor was a loyal aide to<03e0>our previous lord.<04e0>That's why when Nagapur is in trouble<03e0>his lordship comes to our rescue.
What in the God Emperor's up with this!?<04e0>Ever since the Duke of Ghor became<03e0>chairman of the Congress, the people<03e0>of Ghor Castle have been acting so pompous!<04e0>I doubt the duke will be in charge<03e0>for long, though.<04e0>That yama can't fill the shoes of<03e0>our Lord Hermeien!
Even if the Conqueror tries to invade Nagapur, the<03e0>Duke of Ghor will handle it.<04e0>Nothing's gonna happen to this town.
Hello, Rush Sykes.<03e0>I hear you are looking for a way to the Sacred Lands.<03e0>I have some information that may be of help.<04e0>Travel northeast of Nagapur to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Sixth Path of<03e0>Siebenbur<1ce0>. What you desire may be found at the end<03e0>of the road.<04e0>...<04e0>Rush, Irina.<03e0>I think of you as my own grandchildren.<03e0>Please, return safely.
Travel to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Sixth Path of Siebenbur<1ce0>.<03e0>What you desire will be at the end of the road.
It's you...<04e0>Never thought the day would come when I'd be working<03e0>for you.
You again? You know, you don't gotta spy on me all<03e0>the time. I know you haven't got anything to complain<03e0>about, 'cause I'm working hard.<04e0>And I'll continue to work hard...as long as you keep<03e0>paying me.
What, you think that if you don't keep an eye on me<03e0>I'll jump you or something? ...Pssh, whatever, man.<04e0>Seriously, that only happened once. Okay, maybe twice...
You again... You seriously need something better to do<03e0>with your time.<04e0>Aight then, lemme ask you something: what're you<03e0>fighting for? You owe that marquis something?<04e0>Nah... I can see from your face that that ain't the real<03e0>reason... Whatever. No skin off my back either way.
You again...<03e0>How about you leave me alone?
Yo...Rush, or whatever.<04e0>Whadda you think about the state of the world lately?<03e0>I'm not talking 'bout peace or war or anything, just...<03e0>Something ain't quite right, yanno?<04e0>I've been binding Remnants all my life, and it hasn't ever<03e0>felt like it's been feeling lately. It's just... I don't even<03e0>know how to describe it.<04e0>I bet that Marquis of yours is feeling it, too. You can't<03e0>be telling me you haven't noticed anything.
Something's wrong.<03e0>Maybe...Remnants aren't like I always thought they were.
The cries of Remnants...<03e0>The essence of Remnants...<03e0>Dammit! I can't deal with this anymore!<04e0>Aight, Rush, time for you to come clean on this Remnant<03e0>stuff. Howcome you can control 'em so easy when the<03e0>rest of us are bustin' our asses? What'd you do!?<04e0>...<03e0>Sorry. Didn't mean to get heated. I know you're a good<03e0>kid<07f0>look at all the friends you've got.<04e0>I just want an answer. Maybe...maybe we weren't meant<03e0>to have control over Remnants after all...
Hey, Rush, holla.<04e0>So, I decided to stop overthinking all this Remnant stuff.<03e0>All that wallowing and angsting shit, it's not my style.<03e0>So, gimme some work! I'm bored as hell!
Everything is so serene...and boring.
Days of nothingness prove that<03e0>there is peace in your life.
Whatever...
The wife of Celapaleis's Baron Nielsen<03e0>ran off somewhere. No surprise there.<03e0>They're famous for not getting along.
Isn't that exciting?
The tides of social status are nothing<03e0>compared to the current of the ocean<03e0>that is life.
What?
Someone's planning on assassinating Duke Qubine.<03e0>A suspicious woman was seen hanging around the<03e0>area, but I don't think she was questioned or anything.
Isn't that exciting?
Bad rumors spread like wildfire.<03e0>And yet, no one takes action.
Yeah, that's the way it usually is.
The princess of a desert kingdom is in love and<03e0>sneaks out of the castle often to meet her love.

Love is a sword? What?
The princess from the desert kingdom<03e0>eloped with her love!
Isn't that exciting?
Love is a shield that protects one from<03e0>the world of others.
Love is a shield? What?
The conflict between Balterossa and<03e0>Royotia is getting worse by the day!<03e0>Everyone thinks a war is inevitable.
Isn't that exciting?
War is not controlled by emotions.<03e0>Emotions are controlled by war.
...I don't get it.
In a certain moor, the Imperator used his powers<03e0>to seal the entranceway to another realm.
Isn't that exciting?

You're not even the least bit curious?
Any Forest Maiden that vows eternity<03e0>with a Melphinian knight gains the power of<03e0>seeing and hearing whatever her partner does.
Isn't that exciting?
Those who walk together, fall together.<03e0>But it is an easy task, getting back on<03e0>their feet together.
It's true with people you trust.<03e0>Others will just leave you lying on<03e0>the ground.
It seems something happened to the Last Leaf<03e0>in Crookfen. The Forest Maidens and<03e0>the knights of Melphina are taking action.
Isn't that exciting?
Those who have made their vows are<03e0>like the hands of a clock. They may part<03e0>ways, but are bound forever.
The hands of a clock can break, you<03e0>know that, right?
It's almost time for Kosmosfest, but the Cosmos Maiden<03e0>apparently hasn't arrived yet.<03e0>I hope she's safe!
Isn't that exciting?
Life is but a simple maze. The entrance<03e0>and exit can be placed easily, but it takes<03e0>careful designing to enjoy it.
A maze, huh? I do feel lost sometimes.
Rumor has it that the Cosmos Maiden made it to<03e0>the festival and it's about to start. But what should<03e0>be a tranquil event is always disrupted by monsters.
Isn't that exciting?
Tranquility and silence transform<03e0>memories into beasts.
Did something bad happen to you<03e0>in the past?
An old-fashioned woman is looking for someone to<03e0>be her bodyguard. She's in the pub in the city<03e0>with the canals.
Isn't that exciting?
To protect someone, you must protect<03e0>their entire being, as you are protecting<03e0>their future.
If she needs a bodyguard, why doesn't<03e0>she just stay indoors?
The treasures from different lands presented to<03e0>the holy city were stolen! I hear they're being<03e0>sold on the black market.
Isn't that exciting?

You said it! That city needs to get<03e0>with the times.
Someone is looking for these three valuable stones<03e0>that have to do with the desert's past.
Isn't that exciting?
What one is destined to have will<03e0>fall into his hands. It is up to him<03e0>to recognize what he has when he has it.
I wonder what's destined to fall<03e0>into my lap.
A scientist is seeking an assistant to help<03e0>him with some kind of research about magick.

Is that when he's going to stop<03e0>his research? Death?
A horrible monster was sealed by the Imperator<03e0>long ago. And now he's been resurrected!

As long as I'm safe, I don't really<03e0>care about anyone else.
A man with amnesia is searching for<03e0>something he lost in the desert.

If one loses himself, he can find<03e0>himself within his friends' hearts.
Why doesn't he do that then?
A notorious bandit is lurking around Athlum!<03e0>Some say he's waiting for someone.
Isn't that exciting?
One's past should not be invaded<03e0>by others' eyes. It should be passed on<03e0>through his own stories.
People should be trusted. I get it.
Some guy is searching for the statue in<03e0>the Robelia Ruins that supposedly lets one<03e0>reunite with someone far away.

Make sure you wish for something<03e0>small, is that what you're saying?
There was a murder in the big city and<03e0>the assailant is still on the loose!
Isn't that exciting?
Crime is a slippery slope.<03e0>And someday, you hit rock bottom.
And getting back up that slope is<03e0>tough.
A large yama is searching for something<03e0>he lost. He's acting really weird... I wonder<03e0>what his story is.
Isn't that exciting?
What one loses is the mirror to his<03e0>faults.
Silly yama!
A white qsiti was seen rummaging<03e0>through books written about magick.<03e0>Some say he looks familiar...
Isn't that exciting?
Playing with blocks will lead one to eventually<03e0>build a house, a tower, an empire.<03e0>It is all up to potential.
You can only find out your true<03e0>potential once you test it, right?
I heard about these set of twins that are<03e0>great mercenaries. And get this<07f003e0>they're girls!
Isn't that exciting?

When it comes to business, I think<03e0>results are the only thing that matter.

I only water the pretty flowers.
The Honeywell clan does good things for Athlum.<03e0>They've got the trust and respect of the residents.
Isn't that exciting?

Yup. It's not good to trust someone<03e0>who's too good to be true.
Apparently, Torgal of the Athlum generals<03e0>is touchy about his past.

Sorrow can and should be disposed of.
So what you're saying is, get over it.
A long, long time ago, a hero wandered<03e0>the Great Sand Sea.

Those who are ignorant of the justice<03e0>of others do not know the true<03e0>meaning of the word.

The Silver Falcons are going to get<03e0>rid of what's left of the Conqueror's army.<03e0>Good riddance!

Glory is given to a victor until his<03e0>next loss.
That's why the Silver Falcons keep<03e0>slaying the bad guys. They never lose.

[Remnants 11]<03e0>Luminescence is a natural occurence<03e0>that causes light to emit from a Remnant.
[Remnants 12]<03e0>Luminescence occurs in a cycle,<03e0>the length differing for each Remnant.
[Remnants 13]<03e0>A short cycle can be a few minutes,<03e0>while a long cycle can take years.
[Remnants 14]<03e0>One known Luminescence cycle is<03e0>that of the Remnant Ark: three months.
[Remnants 15]<03e0>No one knows why Luminescence<03e0>occurs. Perhaps it is a signal.
[Remnants 16]<03e0>If a Remnant is bound to someone,<03e0>it cannot be bound by anyone else.
[Remnants 17]<03e0>A bound Remnant can only be operated<03e0>by whom it is bound to.
[Remnants 18]<03e0>An unbound Remnant is called<03e0>a Blank Remnant.
[Remnants 19]<03e0>A Collapse is a misfortune triggered by a<03e0>Blank Remnant being unbound for too long.
[Remnants 20]<03e0>The most common effect of a Collapse<03e0>is the spawning of monsters.
[Remnants 21]<03e0>Some forms of Collapse are said<03e0>to affect people's minds.
[Remnants 22]<03e0>Operating a Remnant wears away<03e0>at the operator's soul.
[Remnants 23]<03e0>The core Remnants of each town<03e0>are bound by the town's Lord.
[Remnants 24]<03e0>The Remnant Elysion is currently<03e0>unbound.
[Remnants 25]<03e0>A lord bound to a core Remnant is said<03e0>to have a shorter lifespan than others.
[Remnants 26]<03e0>A Remnant's size does not relate to its strength,<03e0>though the core Remnants have great powers.
[Remnants 27]<03e0>It is inferred that all Remnants were<03e0>created from Elysion.
[Remnants 28]<03e0>Remnants constantly emit resonating waves.
[Remnants 29]<03e0>Remnants are made from an unknown<03e0>substance, unaffected by space or time.
[Remnants 30]<03e0>An unproven theory suggests that<03e0>Remnants are a type of life form.
[The Marshalls 1]<03e0>The Marshalls were an ancient clan,<03e0>infamous for their mysterious powers.
[The Marshalls 2]<03e0>A Marshall did not need a focus<03e0>object to use mystic arts.
[The Marshalls 3]<03e0>The Marshalls used magick, an ancient<03e0>ability that has long been forgotten.
[The Marshalls 4]<03e0>The Marshalls were said to have<03e0>developed many fantastic techniques.
[The Marshalls 5]<03e0>The tablet discovered in Marshallton is one of<03e0>the last surviving relics of the Marshalls' skills.
[The Marshalls 6]<03e0>The Marshall tablet holds the power to seal<03e0>and transform a Remnant into a talisman.
[The Marshalls 7]<03e0>While all such transformed Remnants are called<03e0>talismans, the exact forms they take on differ.
[The Marshalls 8]<03e0>In the form of a talisman, a Remnant<03e0>will not trigger a Collapse.
[The Marshalls 9]<03e0>A Remnant in talisman form can be used<03e0>by anyone. It does not need to be bound.
[The Marshalls 10]<03e0>The Marshalls disappeared from history<03e0>with the age of the Imperator.
[The Third Committee 1]<03e0>The Third Committee is an Academy organization<03e0>that conducts illegal Remnant experiments.
[The Third Committee 2]<03e0>Project HN:<03e0>Development of a man-made Remnant (Hypnos)
[The Third Committee 3]<03e0>Project LO:<03e0>Usage of a flying Remnant for the military
[The Third Committee 4]<03e0>Project SC:<03e0>Usage of a giant Remnant for the military
[The Third Committee 5]<03e0>Project BA:<03e0>Fusion of a Remnant with a mitra
[World Races 1]<03e0>There are four main races in the world:<03e0>mitra, yama, qsiti, and sovani.
[World Races 2]<03e0>It is said the sovani ruled over all<03e0>of the other races during ancient times.
[World Races 3]<03e0>A Marshall has the appearance of a mitra,<03e0>but no one truly knows what they are.
[The Fallen 1]<03e0>A creature once feared as a wrathful god. Records<03e0>of its existence date back hundreds of years.
[The Fallen 2]<03e0>Some say it was created by the world itself<03e0>as a way to rid itself of Remnants.

Ahh... A pity.
If there is no objection, I shall take this.
At last, it is mine.
I was able to gather them all.
Hmph... Fine; I can wait.
There you are.
This is just what I needed.
That should be the last of them.
Hmph, do as you like.
I'll take this!
All according to plan.
And that's everything I needed!
Oh no... How could you...
I'll be takin' that.
Had my eye on this for a while.
Huhhh, looks like a full set.
Keh, what's that all about?
Oh yes...it's as if it were made for me!
With this, I need nothing else.
Marvelous...with this piece, I have finished my collection!
I cannot believe such an affront!
I wanted this! ...I think.
I was looking for this! ...Right?
Then that's all the components I needed! ...Right?
Now that I think of it, maybe I didn't need that after all...
Will you entrust this item to my care?
I have received a good thing.
Good. My preparations are complete.
Regrettable, but I can endure.
Of course I'll be takin' that.
Hell yeah! I got it!
And that's the whole shebang.
Dammit! That was mine!
I understand this is to be mine?
I've hoped to acquire this.
I've gained all the components I need!
Ah... He who hesitates is lost.
You'll let me have this, right?
I got it.
That's the last of them, thank goodness!
I-I didn't get it? Oh...
Hmm, this is nice.
I'd hoped to get this.
And now my components are complete!

Somebody's feeling ballsy.
Oh! That's it!
Lucky me!
Yay! I've got them all!
Oh poo.
I'll be takin' my reward, then.
Good, good.
Finally, I've got the last of 'em.
It's orders, so I'll suck it up...
If nobody else needs it, guess I'll take it.
This thing, huh?
Hmph, looks like that's the last of 'em.
I'll remember that...
Mm-hmm!
This is of great importance.
Ahh...I see I've collected all I need.
Hrm...
I'll take this, thanks.
Thank the Emperor I got this.
Good. I shouldn't need any more components now.
...Guess I'll get the next one.

Whaaat? You cheating-y cheater!

Whaddaya mean, I can't have it?
I want this! I mean, if it's okay...
Yay!
Yay, I got all my components!
Oh...fiddlesticks!
I assume this will be mine?
Eureka!
Brilliant. This is the last component I needed.
Hrm...
Hand it over.
Perfect.
That's the last of them.
Hmph.
I may take this?
We must use this the way it was meant to be used.
At last, I can craft better equipment.
It is of little concern to me.
What am I to do with this?
I'll take this if I must.
Hmm. It seems my collection is complete.
I need nothing.
Heheh, finally, something decent.
Yes...yes! YES!!!
Heheh, one more thing to kill with.
Who took it! Tell me so I can wring your neck!

Combat arts, for sure!
Ahh...<03e0>For what is a knight without a skill for combat?
Definitely mystic arts!
Ahh... Mystic arts are useful skills.
Rush... What should I focus on for training?<03e0>I thought I'd decided, but I'm less certain than<03e0>I thought...

Alright.<03e0>It'll definitely be a challenge, but that's not<03e0>gonna stop me!
Nah, focus on what you've got.
Okay! I'll keep trainin' what I got and learn<03e0>some real kickass moves!
That decision's all up to you.
Ouch...that's harsh.
Rush, whaddya think about me focusing my<03e0>training? It's enough for me to just trust in<03e0>my strength and my equipment, right?
You should go for balance.
Huh, that sounds good.<03e0>Then I could do anything!
Combat arts, for sure!
Oh yeah. That's definitely my style, huh?
Definitely mystic arts!
You think so? Well, I'll do my best.
Hey, Rush, what do you think I should focus<03e0>my training on? I'm worried I'm holding<03e0>the others back...
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Yeah... It suits me, too, I think.<03e0>Awright, no more of this wishy-washy bull.<03e0>Let's go, Rush!
Combat arts suit you 110%.
Yeah... It suits me, too, I think.<03e0>Awright, no more of this wishy-washy bull.<03e0>Let's go, Rush!
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Yeah... It suits me, too, I think.<03e0>Awright, no more of this wishy-washy bull.<03e0>Let's go, Rush!
Rush, my boy, I've found myself in need of<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Have we the time to obtain one?
Sure.
Excellent! Then let's get a move on.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Rush, would you lend me your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>for a while?
Sure, no prob.
So generous! I appreciate it.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
I never imagined you so petty...
Oh, Rush. If you've some free time, why<03e0>don't we fight a bit outside of town?<03e0>Sitting around all day isn't good for you...
Yeah, let's hit it!
As I expected from you! Let's be off!
Kinda busy, sorry.
Hum... Slack on your training and you'll find<03e0>your body rebelling when you really need it.
Hmm... Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue polishing what I know?<03e0>I'm curious, Rush, what do you think?
Try something new!
Hmm! I always have loved learning.
Focus on what you know.
Jack-of-all-trades, master of none, as they<03e0>say...<03e0>Then I'll work on mastering the areas I do know.
That decision's all up to you.
I tip my hat to you... It's just as you say.
Hmm... Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue polishing what I know?<03e0>I'm curious, Rush, what do you think?
Try something new!
Hmm! I always have loved learning.
Focus on what you know.
Jack-of-all-trades, master of none, as they say...<03e0>Then I'll work on mastering the areas I currently<03e0>know.
That decision's all up to you.
I tip my hat to you... It's just as you say.
Rush, what do you think I should focus on?<03e0>Is it really enough to maximize my command<03e0>of mystic arts?
Learn a little bit of everything.
I see...<03e0>I suppose that would avoid being too one-sided.
Combat arts, for sure!
I see... Combat arts are quite dependable.
Definitely mystic arts!
Exactly! Goodness, look at me, doing all this<03e0>worrying over nothing...
Rush, what do you think I should focus on?<03e0>I fear I'm not able to help the others as I should...
Go for balance.
Thank you, Rush.<03e0>You've helped me make a decision.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush.<03e0>You've helped me make a decision.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush.<03e0>You've helped me make a decision.
Rush, I have need of a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Is there time to obtain one?
Yeah, let's go.
Excellent.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see.
Would you allow me to borrow your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?
Sure, no prob.
Thank you.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
Do we have time to engage some monsters?<03e0>It would not do to slack on training.
Sounds like a plan.
Mm. Let's go.
Kinda busy, sorry.
You'll never become stronger with that attitude.
To learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>I've found I cannot decide whether it's worth taking<03e0>energy from my current disciplines.
Go for it!
Heh. Of course.
Focus on what you've got!
Then I shall concentrate on higher-level<03e0>spells in the areas I already study.
You should choose, not me.
Oho... You're full of surprises.
To learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>I've found I cannot decide whether it's worth taking<03e0>energy from my current disciplines.
Go for it!
Heh. Of course.
Just polish what you've got.
Then I shall concentrate on higher-level<03e0>techniques in the areas I already study.
You should decide.
Oho... You're full of surprises.
Am I properly focusing my training? In times<03e0>like this, my lack of discipline could be the<03e0>difference between success and failure for Athlum...
You should go for balance.
Certainly that is the best path for a sovani...
Combat arts, for sure!
Becoming a specialist in man-to-man combat,<03e0>then? Certainly not a bad thing...
Definitely mystic arts!
Focusing the spirit... I admit, this is my personal<03e0>preference.
I wonder... Is there a way I can focus my training to<03e0>be more effective? There must be a way to be more<03e0>helpful to Lord David...
Balance is the key.
Yes... Then, the road before me is clear.<03e0>I'll go forward...for Athlum.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Yes... Then, the road before me is clear.<03e0>I'll go forward...for Athlum.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Yes... Then, the road before me is clear.<03e0>I'll go forward...for Athlum.
There's something I need, young one<07f003e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Come with me to find it.
Okay, sure.
Good. Let's head out.
Sorry...maybe later.
Harumph.
Young one, your<1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>I'd like to put it to good use...
It's all yours.
Appreciated.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Harumph.
You look free, young one.<03e0>Instead of wasting time here, we should hit<03e0>the battlefield!
Sounds like a plan.
Then, follow me.
Kinda busy, sorry.
And you wonder why you're so weak.
Hmm... Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue polishing what I know?<03e0>What's the wiser choice?
Don't run from a challenge!
A challenge, hmm? Fine, I'll give it a shot.
Go with what you know.
Hum. As I'd decided from the start.<03e0>After a bit more practice, I'll show you some<03e0>truly amazing spells.
You gotta choose for yourself.
You don't know either, do you...
Hmm... Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue polishing what I know?<03e0>What's the wiser choice?
Don't run from a challenge!
A challenge, hmm? Fine, I'll give it a shot.
Go with what you know.
Hum. As I'd decided from the start.<03e0>After a bit more practice, I'll show you some<03e0>truly amazing moves.
You should choose, not me.
You don't know either, do you...
What should I focus on from now on?<03e0>I'm not worried or anything, just curious...
Do it all!
That is an option...
Combat arts, for sure!
Mm... I, too, was thinking I would need to<03e0>become even stronger...
Definitely mystic arts!
Mmm... Mystic arts aren't anything to laugh at,<03e0>either, I suppose...
So... Where should I go from here?<03e0>I can only go forward, but in what direction?
Balance is the key.
Mmm... I see.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Mmm... I see.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Mmm... I see.
ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>That's what I need. Do you think we'd<03e0>have time to pick one up?
Sure, no prob.
Really? Great!<03e0>Let's get going!
Sorry...maybe later.
Oh? That's too bad.
Say, Rush, could I have a look at your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>for a little while? I'd like to conduct some testing...
Sure, no prob.
Are you sure? Thanks!
Ehh... I need it right now.
Ahh...
Rush, do you think we'd have some time to go<03e0>battle some? I think I'm on the verge of a<03e0>new discovery!
Sounds like a plan.
Great! Then let's go.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Ah, I see.<03e0>Maybe next time.
Should I start <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or stick with what I've already been learning?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
You think so? Alright. I'll do my best!
Go with what you know.
Ahh, I see.<03e0>Alright, I'll concentrate on the areas I<03e0>already study for now.
You should choose, not me.
I see... Let me give it some more thought.
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue to practice what I already know?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Alright!<03e0>This should be an interesting experiment...
Just polish what you've got.
Alright. I'll focus on the areas I know...<03e0>I'm sure there's a lot more knowledge to<03e0>be gleaned.
You should decide.
You have a point...<03e0>Let me put a little more thought into it.
Rush, what do you think I should be focusing<03e0>on? I've been a little worried, lately...
Being well-rounded is good!
Yes... If you can do a little of everything,<03e0>travel isn't much of an obstacle...
Combat arts, for sure!
When things get tough, that sort of strength<03e0>can be useful, I guess.
Definitely mystic arts!
Sounds helpful to Remnant research!
Say, Rush, what areas do you think I should<03e0>focus on? I'm curious to hear your opinion.
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Thank you, Rush. I'll take your opinion into<03e0>consideration and do my best!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush. I'll take your opinion into<03e0>consideration and do my best!
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush. I'll take your opinion into<03e0>consideration and do my best!
What's good? I'm thinking we should get some<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>It'll be the jump-off.
Alrighty!
Word. Then let's roll.
Sorry, man, maybe later.
You're wyling.
Oh, so that <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>you got? You're gonna let me borrow it, right?
Sure, no prob.
Props, man. That's chill.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Punk.
You trying to get your battle on or something?<03e0>I like kicking ass, not sitting on it.
Yeah, I'm game.
Cool. Let's bounce then.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Pathetic.
So I guess I could learn<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>,<03e0>but it kinda sounds like a waste of time...
No way<07f0>go for it!
Alright. Then I'll try to get it down ASAP.
Yeah, I'd give it a pass.
Alright. Polishing what I already know ain't<03e0>gonna hurt anything.
I dunno... What do you think?
I think I asked you for your opinion...<03e0>Whatever.
Was thinking of learning<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Whadda you think?
Yeah, I'd go for it!
Alright. With some more arts under my belt<03e0>I'd be sick on the battlefield.
Nah, work on what you've got.
What, you think I'm fallin' off?<03e0>...Nah, I hear you. I need to lock down the<03e0>arts I already know.
Whatever you want.
Wow. How unhelpful.
What should I focus on from now on...<03e007f0>Eh? Just talking to myself, never mind.
All-rounder, natch.
Sounds quick and easy.
Combat arts, for sure!
Yeahhh...that sounds about right.
Definitely mystic arts!
Huh... Maybe.
Sup, Rush. I was just thinking about what<03e0>sort of training I should focus on...<03e0>Not that you gotta worry about that.
Balance is the key.
Mmm...<03e0>Sorry for underestimating you all this time.<03e0>From now on it's on!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Mmm...<03e0>Sorry for underestimating you all this time.<03e0>From now on it's on!
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Mmm...<03e0>Sorry for underestimating you all this time.<03e0>From now on it's on!
Rush, I need a favor... I am looking for the <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>I thought together we could find it, perhaps in the blink<03e0>of an eye.
Alrighty!
Really? You are a lifesaver.
Sorry...maybe later.
How unfortunate...
Your <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>is impressive... Yet it would be even more so in my<03e0>possession. What do you think?
...Sure, you can borrow it.
You have my eternal gratitude.<03e0>It shall be used spectacularly.
No, I need to hold onto it.
So cold... Believe me when I say that the ladies<03e0>prefer a man who is warm...if not blazing hot.
Rush... Shall we proceed to the field of battle<03e0>and wreak havoc upon the monster hordes?<03e0>I...must become someone she can depend on...
Sounds like a plan.
Excellent!<03e0>My arm sings with the promise of victory!
Busy now, sorry.
Do you truly think you will attract a lover<03e0>with an attitude like that?
I have the chance to add <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>to my repertoire... Should I?
Go for it!
I don't want to be known as a man afraid of<03e0>commitment... Yet I shall attempt this new<03e0>type of skill.
Nah, I'd give it a pass.
I see. Then I shall focus on what I already know.<03e0>Soon the most beautiful spells you have ever<03e0>seen shall be mine to command!
Whatever you want, dude.
You...you think I'm unreliable, don't you...
ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Should I begin to study it? Or focus on what I<03e0>already know?
Try something new!
A true man isn't tempted by every new face that<03e0>crosses his path... And yet there is something to<03e0>be said for...fresh experiences.
Just polish what you've got.
I see. Then I shall focus on what I already know.<03e0>Soon the most beautiful techniques you have ever<03e0>seen shall be mine to command!
Decide that for yourself.
I see... The answer lies within me, waiting for Fate<03e0>herself to pluck it from my tender breast...<03e0>I shall give her the time she needs.
What should I focus my training on? Alas, it is<03e0>too much for me to even select a single maid<03e0>to lay my affections on...
Being well-rounded is good!
I see... The best of both worlds, as it were.
Combat arts, for sure!
Combat, hm?<03e0>I suppose I am a bit of a swashbuckler.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells, hm?<03e0>I must admit, I am not poor at the mystic arts.
Rush Sykes! I know you see me as unreliable...<03e0>Thus, I ask you<07f0>what should I focus my training on?
All 'rounder is the way to go.
Ahh... Yes, you are right.<03e0>And now it is time I did what I must do.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Ahh... Yes, you are right.<03e0>And now it is time I did what I must do.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Ahh... Yes, you are right.<03e0>And now it is time I did what I must do.
Do you have a moment? Have you heard of<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I think I need one. Shall we search?
Sure, let's go.
Oho. You're a big help.
Sorry...maybe later.
Alright. I'm in no hurry.
What is that...<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Would you lend it to me for a while?
Sure, no prob.
Are you certain? I thank you.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
I feel like I'm getting dull and flabby...<03e0>Shall we fight some monsters for a bit?
Sounds like a plan.
I see you are also a fan of combat.
Kinda busy, sorry.
Ahh... You looked free... My mistake.
Hmm... Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue polishing what I know?<03e0>What's the wiser choice?
Try something new!
Yes...<03e0>Perhaps I could remember something I've lost...
Focus on what you've got!
Ahh... So, I should focus my training on becoming<03e0>more proficient in the areas I know.
You should decide.
Ah...I see.
Hmm... Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue polishing what I know?<03e0>What's the wiser choice?

Yes...<03e0>Perhaps I could remember something I've lost...
Just polish what you've got.
Ahh... So, I should focus my training on becoming<03e0>more proficient in the areas I know.
You should decide.
Ah...I see.
What path should I follow from now on? I don't<03e0>even remember the one I took to get to this point...
All-rounder, natch.
Ahh... With that, no need to worry.
Combat arts, for sure!
My body should remember that...I hope.
Mystic arts, for sure.
My body should remember that...I hope.
What do you think I should focus on from<03e0>now on?<03e0>I value your opinion.
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Yes...yes.<03e0>I will keep this in mind as I go forward.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Yes...yes.<03e0>I will keep this in mind as I go forward.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Yes...yes.<03e0>I will keep this in mind as I go forward.
Master Sykes, might I trouble you for a moment?<03e0>I seek a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>,<03e0>and hoped that you might assist me in obtaining one.
Sure, let's go.
As always, I appreciate your help.
Sorry...maybe later.
Understood... A pity.
Master Sykes, might you be willing to lend me your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?
No prob!
Ohh!<03e0>As always, I appreciate your generosity.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
I never thought<07f003e0>Ah, nothing. Forget I said anything.
Master Sykes, would you accompany me to<03e0>the nearest battlefield? Even at this age,<03e0>it is poor form to shirk one's training.
Yeah, let's go!
I appreciate your indulgence.<03e0>Let us go at once.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Shall I attempt to learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>or focus on areas I already know? At this age,<03e0>it's no small matter to make a decision either way...
Try something new!
You are right...<03e0>I am far too old for pusillanimity!
Stick to what you know.
Understood. I shall focus my training on<03e0>proceeding further down the paths of<03e0>the mystic arts I already know.
You should decide.
Touché. Forgive my show of weakness...<03e0>You are truly wise beyond your years.

As you say...<03e0>I am far too old for pusillanimity!
Just polish what you've got.

You should decide.
Touché. Forgive my show of weakness...<03e0>You are truly wise beyond your years.
How should I focus my training from now on?<03e0>I've found myself plagued with uncertainties<03e0>of late, thus I'd value your opinion, Master Sykes.
All-rounder, natch.
There is truth to your words...<03e0>A knight must be able to perform any task.
Combat arts, for sure!
A knight without a proper command of<03e0>combat arts is but a disgrace.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells can be useful tools in saving lives.
Master Sykes, do you think there's a better way I<03e0>could be focusing my training? Even at this age,<03e0>I sometimes wonder...
Balance is the key.
I am prepared.<03e0>As a knight of the Order of Melphina, I will<03e0>act proudly and without shame.
Combat arts is the way to go.
I am prepared. As a knight of the Order of<03e0>Melphina, I will act proudly and without<03e0>shame.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
I am prepared. As a knight of the Order of<03e0>Melphina, I will act proudly and without<03e0>shame.
Hey, I need some <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>If you got time to sit around and talk, you've<03e0>got time to go get some eh?
Yeah, let's go.
Arright. C'mon.
Sorry...maybe later.
Ah. Don't wanna be seen with me, eh?<03e0>Don't blame you.
So, how about your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Why don'tcha let me take care of it for a while?
Sure, no prob.
F'r real? You're alright.
I kinda need it right now.
And this is why I hate people.
All this sitting around is making me nervous...<03e0>What say we pick up some battles, hmm?
Sounds like a plan.
Good. Let's go.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
*snort*
Guess I could learn<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>,<03e0>but it sounds like a waste of time...
No way<07f0>go for it!
Huh. Guess I'll see if it's useful after all.
Yeah, I'd give it a pass.
Polish up what I already got, eh?
You should decide.
...Right. Forget I asked.
Was thinking of learning<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Whadda you think?
Yeah, I'd go for it!
Alright. I'll give it a go.
Nah, work on what you've got.
Polish up what I already got, eh?
You should decide.
...Right. Forget I asked.
Hey. You think I'm trainin' in the right things?<03e0>...Ridiculous, ain't it? A bandit worrying about<03e0>this type of stuff...
Being well-rounded is good!
Yeah?<03e0>Guess there ain't no weakness in that.
Combat arts, for sure!
Yeah?<03e0>Guess I'm pretty used to hefting weapons<03e0>around.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Yeah... I saw the usefulness of mystic arts<03e0>firsthand when I was actively banditing.
So, whadda you think I should be training in?<03e0>Wanna know what you think.
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Okay. For Reya... And, for friends...<03e0>I'll give it a shot.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Okay. For Reya... And, for friends...<03e0>I'll give it a shot.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Okay. For Reya... And, for friends...<03e0>I'll give it a shot.
Rush, I have need of a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Have we the time to obtain one?
Yeah, let's go.
You have my gratitude. Let us be off.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Rush, might you lend me your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I promise to put it to good use.
Sure, no prob.
Are you certain? I appreciate your generosity.
I kinda need it right now.
Ahh...I see.
Rush, have we time to do some fighting at<03e0>the nearest battlefield? I still must prove to<03e0>my father that I can be a competent knight...
Alright, sure.
You have my gratitude. Let us be off.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Ought I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue my current studies? What do you think, Rush?
Sure! Try something new.
Alright.<03e0>I shall do my best to master this new field.
Stick to what you know.
As you say.<03e0>I shall further refine those spells I do know.
Decide that for yourself.
As you say...<03e0>If Father were to hear of my indecisiveness,<03e0>he would be much displeased...
Ought I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue my current studies? What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Alright.<03e0>I shall do my best to master this new field.
Just polish what you've got.
As you say. I shall further refine those<03e0>techniques I do know.
You should decide.
As you say...<03e0>If Father were to hear of my indecisiveness,<03e0>he would be much displeased...
Rush, may I ask you something? Do you<03e0>think I'm following the right path in my<03e0>training? Where should I have my focus?
You should go for balance.
Certainly, attempting everything leaves no<03e0>deficiency.
Combat arts, for sure!
Focus on the art of combat, ah? Certainly,<03e0>that is necessary for a future ruler...
Mystic arts, for sure.
I see.<03e0>Certainly it is important to master the mystic arts.
Spells, combat arts, or a mix of the two...<03e0>What ought to be my main focus? It is not<03e0>an easy decision.
Balance is the key.
Thank you. From now on I shall work hard to<03e0>earn the trust of the people of Royotia.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Thank you. From now on I shall work hard to<03e0>earn the trust of the people of Royotia.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Thank you. From now on I shall work hard to<03e0>earn the trust of the people of Royotia.
Rush, you know <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>, <03e0>right? Well, I was hoping maybe we could go find<03e0>some if it wasn't too much trouble...
Yeah, let's go.
Really? Thank you so much.<03e0>Let's go, alright?
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Maybe some other time.
Um, Rush...<03e0>Your <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Do you think I could use it for a bit?
No prob!
It's really okay?<03e0>Thank you so much...
I kinda need it right now.
Oh...
Rush, do you think we might be able to<03e0>battle some monsters for a bit? I don't<03e0>want to get too rusty...
Sounds good to me.
Thank you.<03e0>Then, shall we be off?
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Ah, I see.<03e0>Well, maybe next time...
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or just continue my studies? What do you think, Rush?
Go for it!
You think so? Okay...I'll do my best.
Focus on what you've got!
Ahh...that makes sense. I'll try to refine<03e0>the spells I know to be more powerful.
Decide that for yourself.
Ah... You're right. If I can't even decide<03e0>this for myself, how can I help Kate...
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or just continue my studies? What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
You think so? Okay...I'll do my best.
Work on what you know.
Ahh...that makes sense. I'll try to refine<03e0>the techniques I know to be more powerful.
You should decide.
Ah... You're right. If I can't even decide<03e0>this for myself, how can I help Kate...
Rush, do you have a moment? I can't<03e0>decide how I should focus my training...
All-rounder, natch.
Makes sense...<03e0>I wouldn't have to choose either way, would I?
Combat arts, for sure!
Combat, huh? I'd better start working out...
Mystic arts, for sure.
Oh? I guess I'm not that bad at them.
Rush, how should I focus my training<03e0>from now on? Kate won't help me at all...
Balance is the key.
I understand.<03e0>I can't live under the wings of others forever, right?<03e0>I'll do my best to live up to Kate's expectations...
Combat arts is the way to go.
I understand.<03e0>I can't live under the wings of others forever, right?<03e0>I'll do my best to live up to Kate's expectations...
Mystic arts is the way to go.
I understand.<03e0>I can't live under the wings of others forever, right?<03e0>I'll do my best to live up to Kate's expectations...
Ah, Rush, do you have a moment?<03e0>I am looking for <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>s...<03e0>Would you come with me to find one?
Yeah, let's go.
You've my gratitude.
Sorry...maybe later.
It's alright. Sorry for troubling you.
Rush, may I borrow your <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I'd like to put it to use...
Sure, no prob.
Are you certain? I thank you.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
Rush, do we have time to do some fighting?<03e0>I don't want to get rusty.
Sure, no prob.
Thank you.<03e0>Then, shall we be off?
Sorry... Maybe next time.
It's alright. Sorry for troubling you.
Start studying <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or stick to areas I know? Hmm...
Try something new!
As you say. It should be helpful knowledge.
Focus on what you've got!
Understood. I'll focus on making my mystic arts<03e0>as strong as possible.
You should decide.
Forgive me. It's just as you say.
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue to practice what I already know?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Alright.<03e0>I shall do my best to master this new field.
Just polish what you've got.
Alright.<03e0>I'll further refine those techniques I do know.
You should decide.
Forgive me. It's just as you say.
Rush, how should I further my training?<03e0>I'd appreciate your advice...
You should go for balance.
I see... Then I shall attempt it.
Combat arts, for sure!
Combat, ah? I see.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells, ah? I see.
What do you think I should focus on from<03e0>now on?<03e0>I value your opinion.
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Alright.<03e0>I was alone for a long, long time... But now I'll do<03e0>my best to work with everyone and succeed.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Alright.<03e0>I was alone for a long, long time... But now I'll do<03e0>my best to work with everyone and succeed.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Alright.<03e0>I was alone for a long, long time... But now I'll do<03e0>my best to work with everyone and succeed.
Rush, would you do something for me?<03e0>I really need a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Would you come with me to find one?
Sure, let's go.
Excellent. Then, let's not waste any time.
Sorry...maybe later.
Well! I never.
I was just thinking that your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>looked so striking... Might I borrow it for a bit?
Sure, no prob.
I appreciate it.
Ehh... I need it right now.
Well! I never.
Rush, if you have some free time, why don't we<03e0>engage in a battle or two? I admit, I'm not fond<03e0>of being inactive for too long.
Sounds like a plan.
Excellent. Then, let's not waste any time.
Sorry... Maybe next time.
To refuse a lady...!
Hmm... Shall I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue with my current studies?<03e0>Which is the wiser choice?
Try something new!
If you say so. I'll do my best to make it<03e0>worthwhile.
Stick with what you know.
If that's what you truly think, then I'll<03e0>concentrate on what I do know for now.
You should decide.
Truly, it's as you say...<03e0>I will have to give this some more thought.

You should choose, not me.
Truly, it's as you say...<03e0>I will have to give this some more thought.
Rush, what do you think I should focus on to<03e0>better myself? Recently I've been worried<03e0>about my progress...
Do it all!
Not having a particular weakness<03e0>does sound like a good choice.
Combat arts, for sure!
Ahh...<03e0>Then I shall work hard to perfect my combat arts.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Ahh...<03e0>Then I shall work hard to perfect my mystic arts.
Rush, how should I further my training?<03e0>Once again, I'd appreciate your advice...
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Understood.<03e0>I won't stray from my path again.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Understood.<03e0>I won't stray from my path again.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Understood.<03e0>I won't stray from my path again.
Rush, I really need a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Think we could go find one?
Yeah, let's go.
I owe you one.
Sorry...maybe later.
Riiight. Whatever.
Tell me about your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>More specifically, tell me you're gonna hand it over.
No prob!
You serious?<03e0>No tradebacks, got it?
Ehh... I kinda need it.
Rrgh... Don't think I'm gonna forget this.
Hey, hey, time's a wasting!<03e0>Monsters to fight, loot to collect, eh?<03e0>Let's get going!
Sounds good!
That's more like it, kid!
Sorry... Maybe next time.
Seriously?
ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Think that stuff's worth looking into?
Sure! Try something new.
Okay.<03e0>Dunno if it'll be worth anything, but I'll give<03e0>it a shot.
Stick with what you know.
Huh, so polish up what I already got...<03e0>Nothing to lose there.
You should decide.
I decided I wanted to ask you...
ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Think that stuff's worth looking into?

Huh, so polish up what I already got...<03e0>Nothing to lose there.
You should decide.
I decided I wanted to ask you...
What sorts of things should I be focusing my<03e0>training on? I've been kinda uncertain lately...
Do it all!
That didn't take long.
Combat arts, for sure!
Fighting, huh? Can't say I don't like it.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells, huh? Eh, wouldn't quite say I hated 'em...
Hey, Rush. What sort of training should I<03e0>focus on?<03e0>Wanted to get an outside opinion.
Balance is the key.
Alright, I'll trust you on this one.<03e0>Even if it's a bust, at least it's free.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Alright, I'll trust you on this one.<03e0>Even if it's a bust, at least it's free.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Alright, I'll trust you on this one.<03e0>Even if it's a bust, at least it's free.
Oh, so like, <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I totally need some? So, like, let's go on a harvesting<03e0>journey!
Like, totally for sure!
Sweet! This is totally not uncool of you.
Like, no.
That sucks!
So, like, your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>You should totally give it to me.
Okay...
Wow. You're so attentive to my needs.<03e0>Do you like me or something?
Ha ha ha. No.
Ugh. Cheapass.
Who likes loot? I do!<03e0>So, let's go to the battlefield and get some!
Sounds like a plan.
Like, thanks!
Sorry...maybe later.
Refused? Fail.
ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>I bet you don't even know this type of mystic arts?<03e0>but, like, I'm thinking I should learn it.
Yeah! You go, girl.
Like, here's a tip?<03e0>Never say that again.
Work on your current spells.
Really? ...Okay, fine.<03e0>I'll just totally max out my spell power then.
If that's what you want.
Wow. Being passive-aggressive?<03e0>Sooo last year.
So, I was wondering if I should learn<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>I mean, there's other stuff I could be doing...
Go for it!
Okay...<03e0>Hopefully this won't be a complete waste of time.
Stick with what you know.
Really? ...Okay, fine.<03e0>I'll just totally max out my spell power then.
Only you can decide that.
You sound just like an old woman!<03e0>I'd say it was adorable, except that it's not.
Geez, did you know it like takes a lot of work to<03e0>become a witch, or whatever?<03e0>What should I train in the meantime?
Do it all!
An awesome witch like me had better know<03e0>some of everything, right?
Combat arts, for sure!
Like, seriously? You do know that witch<03e0>equals mystic stuff, right?
Mystic arts, for sure.
Amirite? Like, cutie witch Khrynia is def<03e0>down with the mystic arts.
Okay, Rush<07f0>what do you think I should focus<03e0>my training on? I know, it's hard to believe,<03e0>but I want your opinion.
Balance is the key.
Okay. This's like the first step for those of us<03e0>who're gonna control the world.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Okay. This's like the first step for those of us<03e0>who're gonna control the world.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Okay. This's like the first step for those of us<03e0>who're gonna control the world.
Hey. If you've got time to be standing around, why don't<03e0>we go get me some <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?
Alrighty!
Appreciate it.<03e0>C'mon, let's go.
Sorry...maybe later.
Thanks for nothing, punk.
So, you gonna let me borrow your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>or what?
Okay.
Seriously? You aren't half bad.
What.
Ha ha, what a comedian. Asshat.
Hey, how 'bout we go fight some monsters, eh?<03e0>Unlike Rhagoh, I actually like kicking ass.
Sounds good to me.
Awright!<03e0>Let's hit it!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Tsk... Whatever.
You think it's worth it to try learning<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>What would you do?
Try something new!
Alright, I'll give it a shot.<03e0>Spells aren't my strong suit though.
Stick with what you know!
Makes sense. I'll try and polish up what<03e0>I do know to learn more powerful spells.
Decide that for yourself.
You're right. Geez, I sound like Rhagoh.
You think it's worth it to try learning<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>What would you do?
Go for it!
Alright.<03e0>Just know it's not my thing.
Stick with what you know.
Makes sense. I'll try and polish up what<03e0>I do know to learn more powerful skills.
Decide that for yourself.
You're right. Geez, I sound like Rhagoh.
Rush. So, if you were me, what sort of training would<03e0>you focus on? I hate to admit it, but I can't decide.
All-rounder, natch.
Makes sense...<03e0>Don't have to choose just one, eh?
Combat arts, for sure!
Figured you'd say that.<03e0>It is my specialty, after all.
Definitely mystic arts!
Eh? That's more Rhagoh's bag, but eh,<03e0>I'll give it a shot.
What sort of training do you think I should focus on?
Go for balance.
Alright, sounds good. Should be able to make<03e0>up for Rhagoh's slacking, at least.
You're a natural-born fighter.
Alright, sounds good.<03e0>Should be able to make up for Rhagoh's slacking,<03e0>at least.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Alright, sounds good.<03e0>Should be able to make up for Rhagoh's slacking,<03e0>at least.
Rush, do you know <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I think I really need one! Do you think we'd have<03e0>time to pick one up?
Yeah, let's go.
Thank you!<03e0>Okey-dokey, let's go!
Sorry...maybe later.
Awww, really?
Say, Rush, can I see your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Like, for keeps? Or at least for borrows?
Sure, no prob.
Yay! Thank you!
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Oh...
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?<03e0>How about we go fight some monsters<03e0>or something?
Sounds like a plan.
Great! So, come on!
Sorry... Maybe next time.
Awww, really?
Should I start practicing <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or stick with what I've already been learning?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Okay! I'll do my best!
Stick with what you know.
Okey-dokey! I'll keep training so I can learn<03e0>some super-powerful spells, okay?
You should decide.
Lady Marsha tells me that all the time...

Lady Marsha tells me that all the time...
Hmm....what I should focus on for my training?<03e0>I thought maybe being the Cosmos Maiden would <03e0>help me decide, but no dice...
All-rounder, natch.
Thank you!<03e0>I'm not gonna worry<07f0>just work hard!
Combat arts, for sure!
F-fighting, huh?<03e0>Sounds hard... But I'll do my best!
Definitely mystic arts!
Mmm...<03e0>The Cosmos Maiden can't not do mystic arts, right?
I'm a little worried about my training, and I<03e0>don't know who else to ask...
Balance is the key.
Okay!<03e0>As the Cosmos Maiden, I'm going to give it my all!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Okay!<03e0>As the Cosmos Maiden, I'm going to give it my all!
Mystic arts is the way to go.

Heya boyo. Reckon we might have the time<03e0>to look for some <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?
Sure, let's go.
You're a big help.<03e0>Let's be off, then.
Sorry, maybe later.
I see...<03e0>Maybe next time, then.
So, you might have noticed me eyeing your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Would you mind lendin' it to me for a bit?
Sure, no prob.
Thank ye kindly.<03e0>Don't see many kind souls like you anymore!
Ehh... I need it right now.
...
Rush, if you've got a moment, let's fight a bit outside<03e0>of town, shall we? Trainin's the most important part<03e0>of being a mercenary, ya know!
Sounds like a plan.
That's what I like to hear.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Hrn...
So I was thinking of learning<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Think that's a good idea?
Yeah, go for it!
Alright, then. The more you know, eh?
Work on your current spells.
Alright, then. I'm sure the mystic arts I know<03e0>could do with a polish, eh?
You should decide.
Ahh... Yea, my sis would be disappointed to<03e0>hear me giving this sort o' wishy-washy talk.
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue to practice what I already know?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Alright, then. The more you know, eh?
Just polish what you've got.
Alright, then. I'm sure the arts I know could<03e0>do with a polish, eh?
Decide that for yourself.
Ahh... Yea, my sis would be disappointed to<03e0>hear me giving this sort o' wishy-washy talk.
What sorts of things should I be focusing my<03e0>training on? I've been kinda uncertain lately...
All-rounder, natch.
Fair enough. Then, time to get started!
Combat arts, for sure!
Fair enough. Then, time to get started!
Definitely mystic arts!
Fair enough. Then, time to get started!
Rush, how do you think I should focus my training?<03e0>I'd appreciate your advice...
Balance is the key.
Right. Can't believe I've been wastin' all this<03e0>time... Alright, I'm gonna redouble my training,<03e0>for my sister's sake.
Combat arts is the way to go.

Hey, greenhorn. You ever heard of<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I bet you would if you came with me to find some.
Okay, sure.
Then come on.
Sorry...maybe later.
Seriously? You're turning me down?
Tell me about your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>More specifically, tell me you're gonna hand it over.
Sure, no prob.
Then, I'll be taking that!
I kinda need it right now.
*snort*
Hey, greenhorn.<03e0>How 'bout we hit the battlefields?<03e0>You could use the training, eh?
Yeah, yeah. Let's go!
Follow me!
Whatever dude, later, maybe.
Whaaat?<03e0>I don't give invitations to just anybody.
Start studying <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or stick to areas I know? Hmm...
Try something new!
I doubt anyone needs to get any more powerful<03e0>than I already am, but sure, I'll give it a shot.
Focus on what you've got!
The thought of me having even more powerful spells at<03e0>my disposal is pretty ominous, innit? But yeah,<03e0>I'll keep at it.
You should decide.
I can't believe I'm getting this from you.

Okay, pop quiz, hotshot.<03e0>You're an incredible mercenary.<03e0>What do you focus on?
Do it all!
Makes sense, don't it?<03e0>I mean, I can already do everything, after all.
Combat arts, for sure!
I know, right?<03e0>Of course, I've already mastered pretty much<03e0>all there is to know about combat.
Definitely mystic arts!
I know, right?<03e0>Of course, I've already mastered pretty much<03e0>all there is to know about spellcasting.
Alright, kid, what do you think?<03e0>Should I focus my training on something new?<03e0>Or am I already too godlike already?
Balance is the key.
Awright. It'll take some training, but that's<03e0>what you gotta do if you wanna be known<03e0>as the king!

Mystic arts is the way to go.
Awright. It'll take some training, but that's<03e0>what you gotta do if you wanna be known<03e0>as the king!
Do you have a moment?<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>, have you heard of it?<03e0>I think I need one. Shall we search?
Yeah, let's go.
Good, good.<03e0>Then let's get cracking.
Sorry...maybe later.
A pity, that...
Your <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Would you mind lending it to me for a while?
Sure, no prob.
Ahh... What a gracious child.
Ehh... I need it right now.
Tsk...
Rush, dear boy, shall we fight a bit?<03e0>Once you get to be my age, if you keep still<03e0>for too long, you can't get moving again...
Sounds like a plan.
Excellent. Let's be off, then.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Harumph...<03e0>What happened to respecting one's elders?
Hmm... <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>sounds interesting enough, hmm? But learning new arts<03e0>is a challenge when you're my age...
Try something new!
Ho ho ho...<03e0>Alright. Let's see what these old bones can do.
Focus on what you've got!
Understood. I'll focus on getting the most out<03e0>of what I already know.
Decide that for yourself.
Ha ha ha...<03e0>From the mouths of babes...
Hmm... <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>sounds interesting enough, hmm? But learning new arts<03e0>is a challenge when you're my age...
You can do it!
Really!<03e0>Then, let's see if this old dog can learn<03e0>a new trick.
Stick with what you know.
Understood.<03e0>I'll focus on polishing my combat arts.
Decide that for yourself.
Ha ha ha...<03e0>From the mouths of babes...
What sorts of focus should I have to my training?<03e0>I don't want to hold you kids back...
All-rounder, natch.
I may be a decrepit old fighter, but I'll do<03e0>my best.
Combat arts, for sure!
With the proper techniques, even the weakest<03e0>of men can hold their own in a fight.
Definitely mystic arts!
Mystic arts can help friends out of tight spots,<03e0>hmm.
Rush, dear boy, old as I am I feel strange to ask<03e0>you, but what sort of training do you think I should<03e0>pursue from now on?
Go for balance.
Excellent.<03e0>Just watch, son<07f0>this old man's in it 'til<03e0>the end!

Rush, I really need a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Think we could go find one?
Sure, no prob.
Let's get going, then.
Sorry...maybe later.
Ah, I see.
Hey, would you let me borrow your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>for a while?
Sure, no prob.
Seriously? Thanks.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
Rush, think we could hit the battlefields<03e0>for a bit? I want to work on some spells.
Sounds like a plan.
Appreciate it. Come on!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
...
Wonder if I should look into <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...
Try something new!
Alright. I'm always up for a challenge!
Focus on what you've got!
Yes... I'll continue my training so that I can<03e0>learn even more powerful spells.
You should decide.
Seems that way...<03e0>Let me think on it some more.

I wonder what I should focus on for my training...<03e0>I wanna be helpful and all, you know?
Try a little of everything.
I guess... Best of both worlds, huh?
Combat arts, for sure!
C-combat arts, huh...<03e0>I totally blew at that before, but I guess I can<03e0>give it a try...
Definitely mystic arts!
Yeah, that makes sense... I've trained all this<03e0>time to be a spellcrafter, after all.
Hey, Rush<07f0>do you think I'm doing okay,<03e0>helping everyone out? If you think there's<03e0>a way I can be more useful...
Balance is the key.
Right...<03e0>And if I work hard, I know I can make it happen.

Hey! You know what would be super-special awesome?<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>!<03e0>Let's find some!
Yeah, let's go.
Awesome-possum! So let's saddle up!
Sorry, dude.
Guess somebody's got their ticket for the failboat.
Your <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>!<03e0>You must give me it!
O-kay...
Really? Really!? Sweeto!
Uhh...no.
Ooh, aren't we Mr. Grabby-hands, keeping all<03e0>the loot for himself... Well, poo on your shoe<03e0>and crap in your lap!
Heya, Rush!<03e0>Don'tcha think it's time for a little of that<03e0>ultra-violence? Let's go fight monsters!
Sounds like a plan.
Awright! It's clobberin' time!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Whaaat?  You're busy? Too busy for me!?<03e0>...Why is everyone always too busy for me...
Hey Rush... Should I learn this new type of arts,<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I mean, what if I'm bad at it<07f0>er, I mean, it sucks?
Try something new!
Yeah? I guess I am a natural.<03e0>Great idea!
Focus on what you've got!
Yeah? Okay! I'll work on what I've got until<03e0>I'm the mystic arts master!
You should decide.
Urg... I'm not good at being the decider...
So it'd be pretty awesome to learn<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>, huh...<03e0>But maybe I should stick with what I've got for now...
Try something new!
I know, right?<03e0>More arts equals more awesome!
Just polish what you've got.
I know, right? I'll polish what I know until<03e0>they're the shining star I am! ...Or whatever.
Decide that for yourself.
Geh... I asked you because I don't like<03e0>making decisions...
Hey, Rush, what should I train from now on<03e0>to become more awesomer? I can't think of<03e0>how to become any more incredible myself...
Go for balance.
Oh yeah? That sounds good.
Combat arts, for sure!
Oh yeah? That sounds good.
Definitely mystic arts!
Oh yeah? That sounds good.
Rush, Rush! You gotta help me<07f0>this is very important!<03e0>What should I train in? I can't commit, so you decide.
All 'rounder is the way to go.
You know, wishy-washy schmooping around is my<03e0>tragic flaw. But since you just made the decision, all I<03e0>have to do is blame you when it goes wrong! Thanks!

Hey, kid, you know<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>, right?<03e0>Why don't we go out and find some?
Yeah, let's go.
Appreciate it, kid. Let's head out.
Sorry...maybe later.
Whaaat!?
Your <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Mind lending it to me for a while?
Sure, no prob.
Appreciate it, kid.
Ehh...kinda need it right now.
Are you serious!?
Say, Rush. I'm getting antsy...<03e0>What say we pick up some battles, hmm?
Sounds good to me!
Great! Let's get hopping!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Whaaat!?
Start studying <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or stick to areas I know? Hmm...
Try something new!
Yes, yes, sounds like that should be good<03e0>and powerful.
Focus on what you've got!
Huh, alright.<03e0>I'll beef up my skills so I can learn more<03e0>powerful spells!
You should decide.
Gah, you sound like Pagus...

Gah, you sound like Maddox...
Hey, kid. What do you think I should be<03e0>focusing my training on? I've been thinking<03e0>day and night and I still can't decide.
Try a little of everything.
Hey, that sounds good! Alright, done.<03e0>That's what I'm doing.
Combat arts, for sure!
Hey, that sounds good! Alright, done.<03e0>That's what I'm doing.
Definitely mystic arts!
You said it! Yup, that's what I'm gonna do!
Ohh, hey, kid. So, I've been thinking about<03e0>my training again... Yeah, even a guy like me's<03e0>gotta think about the future.
Balance is the key.
Huh...huh, alright. Can't be letting Pagus and<03e0>Maddox be the only ones looking like heroes!

Rush, I'd really like a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Do you think we'd have time to pick one up?
Yeah, let's go.
Thanks!
Sorry...maybe later.
Oh, you must be pretty busy!
Say, Rush, can I maybe borrow your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?
Sure, no prob.
For real? Thanks a million!
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Aww...
Hi-hi, Rush! I really wanna do some training...<03e0>Can we go fight monsters, huh, can we can we?
Okay, sure.
Thanks! I promise to get even stronger!
Sorry...maybe later.
Ahh, okay... I guess you're pretty busy, huh...
Hi, Rush. So I was wondering if I should learn<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...
Try something new!
You think? Okay, I'll give it a go...<03e0>Hopefully it'll make me stronger!
Focus on what you've got!
Huhhh, so I should study harder so I can learn<03e0>more powerful spells? Got it!
You should decide.

Yeah, let's go.
Ho ho ho. You have my gratitude.
Sorry...maybe later.
A pity.
Say, Rush, would you could lend me your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>for a bit?
Sure, no prob.
Ho ho ho. You have my gratitude.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Coldblooded...
Rush, do we have time to do some fighting<03e0>at the nearest battlefield? My usual training<03e0>doesn't feel like it was enough today...
Sounds like a plan.
Ho ho ho!<03e0>This should be fun!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
...
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue to refine what I already know?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Ho ho ho... Alright.<03e0>Let's see what these old bones can do.
Focus on what you've got!
Hum, hum, I see, I see!<03e0>Then, I'll continue to train so that I can learn<03e0>more powerful spells.

You sound like Sibal... *sigh*
Rush, do you think my training is going in<03e0>the correct direction?<03e0>I've been a little worried of late.
Try a little of everything.
Ho ho ho, there wouldn't be anything to worry<03e0>about in that case, ah.
Focus on combat arts!
Alright!<03e0>Believe it or not, I was an army general! I have<03e0>utmost confidence in my abilities.
Focus on mystic arts!
Alright!<03e0>Believe it or not, I was an army general! I have<03e0>utmost confidence in my abilities.
Rush, what do you think about my current<03e0>progress? I want to be as helpful as I can.
Balance is the key.
Alright, Rush. I'm decided.<03e0>This old man's still got a lot to fight for!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Alright, Rush. I'm decided.<03e0>This old man's still got a lot to fight for!

Understood.<03e0>It seems there's a lot more for me to work on!
I need a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>,<03e0>so you should take the time to get me one.
Alright!
All according to plan.<03e0>Come.
Sorry.
...You will regret this.
That <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0> you have.<03e0>Give it to me.
Sure!
All according to plan.<03e0>Finally, it is mine...
Mmm, no, sorry.
Rrgh... I will remember this.
If you are as free as you seem, then let's<03e0>find a place to fight. I'm incredibly bored.<03e0>Humor me.
Let's go!
All according to plan.<03e0>Let us go.
Sorry... Maybe another time.
Rrgh...
Study <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>, or<03e0>to continue one's current studies? ...I realize thinking is<03e0>trying for you, but what would you do?
Anything new is worth trying!
Heh. Obviously I had already planned to do that.
Focus on what you know.
Learn more powerful forms of the mystic arts<03e0>I know? Of course I've decided to do that.
You gotta choose for yourself.
What a pathetically mitra-like answer.
Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>,<03e0>a brand-new technique, or continue honing my current<03e0>skills? You may give your opinion this one and only time.

Jack-of-all-trades is ace.
Heh. Obviously.
Combat arts, for sure.
Heh. Obviously.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Heh. Obviously.
What should I focus on now, to become<03e0>the perfect fighter? I certainly won't be<03e0>outdone by a loser like Torgal.
All 'rounder is the way to go.
Hmm. I suppose that to complete my training,<03e0>I can waste a little more time with you people.
Go for the fighting!
Hmm. I suppose that to complete my training,<03e0>I can waste a little more time with you people.
Become a mystic master!
Hmm. I suppose that to complete my training,<03e0>I can waste a little more time with you people.
Rush, I have need of a<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Is there time to find one?
Sure, no problem.
Thank you. I am in your debt.
Sorry...maybe later.
A pity.
Would you allow me to borrow your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?
No prob!
Thank you. You've been a big help.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Forgive me. I spoke out of turn.
Rush, do we have time to engage some monsters?<03e0>It would not do to slack on training.
Sounds like a plan.
Ahh.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
I see...
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue to refine what I already know?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
As you say. It should be helpful knowledge.
Focus on what you've got!
Understood. I'll focus on polishing the spells<03e0>I know to be as strong as possible.
You should decide.
I was told that before, once...

An unerring judgment.<03e0>Of course, I expected nothing less.
Combat arts, for sure!

Uhh...okay.
Then come<07f0>quickly!
Uhh...maybe later.
Impudent whelp...!
What is that...<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Give it to me at once.
Since you asked so nicely...
What a surprisingly pleasant child.
No, I don't think so.
...Smart-mouthed whelp!
Boy! Let us go to the fields of battle and<03e0>destroy all in our path! I shall show you<03e0>the greatness of the sovani!
Okay, I'm game.
Come!
Uhh...not right now.
Pathetic mitra worm...
To learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>or not... If you truly would claim to lead this group,<03e0>then you must give your opinion!
Go for it.
Heh... You are wiser than your years...we are<03e0>in agreement. This spell would be a great boon<03e0>to my skill set.
Stick with what you know.
Heh...we are in agreement. At this point<03e0>there is no other choice than to become<03e0>even more proficient at my current skills.

Rush<07f0>I feel great today! My hands itch to<03e0>clutch a blade... To feel the sweet resistance<03e0>of armor and flesh...
Yeah! Let's go fight!
Heh heh heh heh... Let's go...
I'm busy now, sorry.
Heh...heheheh... Mhmhmhm...

Good heavens, child. You're going to hurt<03e0>yourself with all those weapons. You'd<03e0>better get rid of some before getting more.
Now then, you know you don't need<03e0>that many shields. Why don't you sell<03e0>or discard some, hmm?
I'm sorry, dear, but I don't think you can<03e0>carry any more accessories. Why don't<03e0>you sell or discard some?
That's enough of those, dear, don't you<03e0>think? Why don't you sell or discard<03e0>some before buying more?

The Union Board has areas for lead ranks and back ranks.<03e0>Generally, the front three rows are for the lead ranks, while<03e0>the rear two are for back ranks. The lead ranks are best at<03e0>dealing and defending against physical damage, while the<03e0>back ranks are good for mystic attacks and defense.
A formation's strength depends on the members of the<03e0>union performing it. Some characters are particularly<03e0>effective in certain formations. Try different<03e0>combinations and see what happens!
Change locations through the <1be0ffbe34ff>world map<1ce0>. By selecting<03e0>a place on the map, you can instantly travel there.

Battle Commands
Pressing <1be040c0ffff2be01e00f8fff8fff8ff010000002be01f00f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0> selects targets, while<03e0>pressing <1be040c0ffff2be01c00f8fff8fff8ff010000002be01d00f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0> selects battle commands.<03e0>Pressing <1be040c0ffff2be0>%<f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0> displays the status of the units in<03e0>the currently selected union. You can <1be0ff4060ff>check units'<03e0>actions and any status ailments<1ce0>.
Deadlock
When unions are caught in close combat, it is<03e0>known as <1be0ffbe34ff>Deadlock<1ce0>. In such situations, the two<03e0>sides must battle until only one is left.
While in <1be0ffbe34ff>Deadlock<1ce0>, <1be0ff4060ff>targeting is limited<1ce0>.<03e0>Only adjacent unions may be targeted.
When targets are changed to adjacent unions, certain<03e0>commands can break Deadlock. When breaking free<03e0>from Deadlock, the opposing union has a free chance<03e0>to attack. Don't act too rashly in these situations!
A Mystic Chance<1ce0> gives the opportunity to learn a new<03e0>Mystic Art, or level up an existing Mystic Art. You may<03e0>choose the art you would like to learn from a list.
Captured monsters may be <1be0ffbe34ff>split<1ce0> for components.<03e0>However, intact monsters may be sold in certain shops<03e0>for high prices. Choose wisely<07f0>you only get the choice<03e0>to split a monster once.
Once certain monsters have been sold to shops,<03e0>those shops may begin selling <1be0ffbe34ff>trade goods<1ce0>.
This is how units in the party can request certain loot.<03e0>Units try to collect items to strengthen their equipment.
A unit's request for an item can be removed<03e0>from the list by selecting them.
Battle Controls
Pressing <1be040c0ffff2be01e00f8fff8fff8ff010000002be01f00f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0> switches targets, while<03e0>pressing <1be040c0ffff2be01c00f8fff8fff8ff010000002be01d00f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0> selects battle commands.<03e0>Select a command with <1be040c0ffff2be0> <f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0>, or cancel with <1be040c0ffff2be0>!<f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0>.
Battle
Each entity in a battle is called a <1be0ffbe34ff>unit<1ce0>.<03e0>These units are organized into groups, called <1be0ffbe34ff>unions<1ce0>.
In battle, you will <1be0ff4060ff>command friendly unions for<03e0>large-scale assaults<1ce0>. The specific directions you may<03e0>give are displayed as <1be0ffbe34ff>battle commands<1ce0>.
At the top right of the screen is a <1be0ffbe34ff>battle<03e0>navigation map<1ce0> showing the positions of<03e0>all unions engaged in battle.
Available battle commands change depending on<03e0>conditions such as the positions and makeup of<03e0>friendly and enemy unions. Keep these conditions in<03e0>mind to give appropriate battle orders.
Morale
The large red and blue bar across the top of the screen<03e0>is called the <1be0ffbe34ff>Morale Gauge<1ce0>. It measures you and your<03e0>enemies' will to fight.
As morale rises, attacks become stronger and more<03e0>effective. Conversely, as morale falls, defenses weaken<03e0>and unions do less damage.
Morale fluctuates <1be0ff4060ff>based on the performance of both<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>sides in battle<1ce0>. Make it a habit to keep track of your<03e0>troops' morale.
Critical Trigger
Sometimes during battle, a <1be0ffbe34ff>Trigger Chance<1ce0> will occur.<03e0>During a Trigger Chance, you'll be given a brief opportunity<03e0>to press a certain button on the controller.<03e0>A well-timed button press will launch a <1be0ffbe34ff>Critical Trigger<1ce0>,<03e0>giving your side a definite advantage in battle.
Successful Trigger Chances while on the attack will<03e0>launch a <1be0ffbe34ff>Critical Offense<1ce0>. This will cause the next<03e0>friendly unit to act faster than usual.
Successful Trigger Chances while being attacked<03e0>launch a <1be0ffbe34ff>Critical Defense<1ce0>. This can change a simple<03e0>block to a shield bash, or a dodge to a counterattack.
If you find you just can't keep up with the timing,<03e0>Critical Triggers can be switched to occur<03e0>automatically through the Config Menu.
Critical Trigger Settings<1ce0> have been added to<03e0>the Config Menu!
Guest Unions
When a <1be0ffbe34ff>guest union<1ce0> joins the party, <1be0ff4060ff>you cannot assign<03e0>it battle commands<1ce007f0>it acts on its own. See if you can<03e0>determine how to support your guest in battles!
Enemy Advantage
If you are touched by a monster in the field,<03e0>the following battle will be to the <1be0ffbe34ff>enemy's<03e0>advantage<1ce0>. This can be avoided by <1be0ff4060ff>engaging<03e0>monsters<1ce0> in battle yourself.
KO
A union's HP is the sum of each member's HP.<03e0>Instead of worrying about the HP of individual<03e0>units, watch that of the union instead. If the<03e01be0ff4060ff>union's HP falls to 0, then the whole union is<03e0>Incapacitated<1ce0>, and will be unable to act.
Botch
If a union's leader falls in battle, it is a <1be0ffbe34ff>Botch<1ce0>.<03e0>Afterwards, that union can no longer accept battle<03e0>commands, meaning the remaining members<03e0>cannot be commanded.
Flank Attack
When in Deadlock, if a union is attacked from the<03e0>side, it is known as a <1be0ffbe34ff>Flank Attack<1ce0>. It is possible<03e0>to be flanked by two unions at a time.<03e01be0ff4060ff>Unions performing Flank Attacks deal extra damage<1ce0>.
Rear Assault
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by<03e0>two unions, any further unions Deadlocking the<03e0>victim union launch a <1be0ffbe34ff>Rear Assault<1ce0>.<03e01be0ff4060ff>Unions performing Rear Assaults deal extra damage<1ce0>.
Massive Strike
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by<03e0>two unions and Rear Assaulted by a third, any<03e0>further unions Deadlocking the victim union<03e0>launch a <1be0ffbe34ff>Massive Strike<1ce0>. <1be0ff4060ff>Unions participating<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>in a Massive Strike deal extra damage<1ce0>.
Deadlock Interference
If an enemy union is attempting to Deadlock a<03e0>friendly union but instead is caught in Deadlock<03e0>itself, this is called <1be0ffbe34ff>Interference<1ce0>.<03e0>When it's the player's side that gets caught,<03e0>it is called <1be0ffbe34ff>Interception<1ce0>.
Raidlock
It is possible to force a union into Deadlock without<03e0>being physically nearby. This is called a <1be0ffbe34ff>Raidlock<1ce0>.<03e01be0ff4060ff>Damage dealt increases during a Raidlock.
Directing units to use mystic attacks will make<03e0>them <1be0ff4060ff>channel energy through their weapons to<03e0>perform mystic arts<1ce0>. Mystic arts encompass<03e0>everything from long-range attacks to recovery<03e0>spells. However, they can take a long time to cast.
When you direct units to do physical attacks, they'll<03e01be0ff4060ff>attack with their equipped weapon, or perform<03e0>combat arts<1ce0>. You can learn different combat arts<03e0>depending on your wield style, so try different<03e0>combinations and see what happens.
By selecting <1be0ffbe34ff>Quests<1ce0> on the Party Menu,<03e0>you can check your current progress.

LOCATION TIPS DUMMY
Action Point<1ce0> Strategies<03e0>Every time a unit performs arts in battle, AP is consumed.<03e0>However, <1be0ff4060ff>AP is recovered each turn<1ce0>, so don't feel like<03e0>you have to go out of your way to conserve it.<03e0>Item arts consume materials, and thus do not consume AP.
Each character in battle is called a <1be0ffbe34ff>unit<1ce0>, and can be<03e0>grouped into <1be0ffbe34ff>unions<1ce0> through the Union Board on the<03e0>main menu. <1be0ff4060ff>Unions share aggregate HP and AP, and<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>act as a single entity in battle<1ce0>. A union's makeup can<03e0>have a dramatic impact on battles. Try different combos!
Units can be grouped into unions through the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Union Board<1ce0> on the main menu. By arranging unions,<03e0>you can <1be0ff4060ff>cover the units' specific weaknesses and take<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>advantage of their strengths<1ce0>. There are countless<03e0>combinations of units<07f0>try to find the most effective ones.
The myriad skills a unit learns are known as <1be0ffbe34ff>arts<1ce0>.<03e0>Arts become more powerful as they are used.<03e0>Frequently using arts in the same category<03e0>enables the user to learn stronger arts of that category.
Rush is able to learn many types of arts.<03e0>By focusing on <1be0ffbe34ff>armed combat<1ce0>, he learns <1be0ffbe34ff>combat arts<1ce0>.<03e0>By finding <1be0ffbe34ff>gems<1ce0> that allow one to focus mystic<03e0>energy, he may learn <1be0ffbe34ff>mystic arts<1ce0>. By finding<03e01be0ffbe34ff>recipes<1ce0> for crafting, he can learn <1be0ffbe34ff>item arts<1ce0>.
Special physical attacks performed with weapons are<03e0>called <1be0ffbe34ff>combat arts<1ce0>. Combat arts differ based on the<03e0>equipped weapon and wield style. Make certain to do<03e0>plenty of experimentation if you wish to get them all.
Channeling arcane energy through weapons is known<03e0>as <1be0ffbe34ff>mystic arts<1ce0>. Mystic arts encompass a wide range<03e0>of skills, from long-range attacks to recovery spells.<03e0>However, they take time to cast, requiring some degree<03e0>of planning.
*<1be0ffbe34ff>Invocations<1ce0> are close-range mystic attack spells.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Evocations<1ce0> are long-range mystic attack spells.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Hexes<1ce0> are status-affecting support spells.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Remedies<1ce0> are spells that recover status or HP.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Psionics<1ce0> allow casters to control the actions of foes.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Wards<1ce0> allow casters to support allies.
Item arts<1ce0> are skills using consumables to create<03e0>useful things such as potions or herbs. Item arts<03e0>consume items instead of AP, and are relatively<03e0>quick to cast. Consumables can be found in specialty<03e0>shops, or by harvesting in the field.
*<1be0ffbe34ff>Herbs<1ce0> combine plants for recovery.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Potions<1ce0> combine liquids for useful supplements.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Lotions<1ce0> combine medicines to make healing balms.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Explosives<1ce0> combine explosive powders.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Shards<1ce0> can be fused and used for attacks.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Traps<1ce0> are made from special parts to trip up the foe.
The <1be0ffbe34ff>one-handed<1ce0> wield style is speedy and allows for<03e0>users to equip a shield. However, its attack power is low.<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Power grip<1ce0> wield style has increased<03e0>strength, but attacks take longer.<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Dual wield<1ce0> style is unmatched in attack<03e0>power, but makes it nigh impossible to avoid attacks.
Sovani can <1be0ffbe34ff>quad wield<1ce0>, using four weapons at once<03e0>for crushing attack strength. Their <1be0ffbe34ff>dual power grip<1ce003e0>delivers even more powerful blows. However, both<03e0>types of attacks take longer to pull off.
Certain battle commands can allow a unit to change<03e0>wield styles during battle. This is limited by the type<03e0>of weapon the unit currently has equipped. For<03e0>example, if a unit equips a two-handed weapon,<03e0>it cannot change its wield style from two-handed.
Equipment comes in four sizes: small, midsize, large,<03e0>and huge. In general, the sizes are split by race:<03e0>qsiti small and midsize, mitra midsize and large,<03e0>and yama large and huge. Sovani are limited to<03e0>special sovani weapons, and do not use shields.
When units are placed on the Union Board, they may<03e0>be arranged in special patterns called <1be0ffbe34ff>formations<1ce0>.<03e01be0ff4060ff>Formations grant unions certain effects in battle<1ce0>.<03e0>They are learnt and improved through special items<03e0>found across the world, so keep an eye out.
When units are placed in a formation, <1be0ff4060ff>units in the<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>lead ranks have increased physical attack and defense<1ce0>,<03e0>while <1be0ff4060ff>units in the back ranks have increased<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>mystic attack and defense<1ce0>. Keep this in<03e0>mind when arranging your units.
Some formations can level up when certain<03e0>conditions are met. While formations already grant<03e0>certain bonuses to different stats, these <1be0ffbe34ff>variant<1ce003e01be0ffbe34ff>formations<1ce0> will grant even greater bonuses.
When unions are caught in close combat, it is<03e0>known as <1be0ffbe34ff>Deadlock<1ce0>. In such situations, the two<03e0>unions are set in what they may target. If a Deadlocked<03e0>union is commanded to perform long-range attacks,<03e0>support skills, or movements, Deadlock is broken.
Canceling Deadlock leaves a union wide open to<03e0>attack and gives the opposite union a large<03e0>damage bonus. Keep this in mind.
If a Deadlocked union is melee attacked from the<03e0>side, it is known as a <1be0ffbe34ff>Flank Attack<1ce0>. It is possible<03e0>to be flanked by two unions at a time.<03e01be0ff4060ff>Unions performing Flank Attacks deal extra damage.
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by<03e0>two unions, any further union Deadlocking the<03e0>victim union launches a <1be0ffbe34ff>Rear Assault<1ce0>.<03e01be0ff4060ff>Unions performing Rear Assaults deal extra damage.
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by<03e0>two unions and Rear Assaulted by a third, any<03e0>further unions Deadlocking the victim union<03e0>launch a <1be0ffbe34ff>Massive Strike<1ce0>. <1be0ff4060ff>Unions participating<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>in a Massive Strike deal extra damage<1ce0>.
Some special unions, such as those containing certain<03e0>extremely large units, are able to Deadlock multiple unions<03e0>at once. This is called a <1be0ffbe34ff>Multi Deadlock<1ce0>.
A union victim to a Flank Attack, Rear Assault, or<03e0>Massive Strike will be hit for additional damage.<03e0>The damage bonus for Rear Assault and Massive<03e0>Strike is greater than that for Flank Attack.
It is possible to force a union into Deadlock without<03e0>being physically near. This is called a <1be0ffbe34ff>Raidlock<1ce0>.<03e0>While raiding, the target union is hit for extra damage,<03e0>but the raid only lasts for one turn.
Weapons come in three main categories, dealing certain types of damage:<03e0>* Swords and katana, or <1be0ffbe34ff>blades<1ce0>, mainly deal <1be0ffbe34ff>slashing damage<1ce0>.<03e0>* Axes and maces, or <1be0ffbe34ff>breakers<1ce0>, mainly deal <1be0ffbe34ff>mauling damage<1ce0>.<03e0>* Spears and staves, or <1be0ffbe34ff>polearms<1ce0>, mainly deal <1be0ffbe34ff>bludgeoning<1ce0> or <1be0ffbe34ff>piercing damage<1ce0>.<03e0>Be mindful of the types of weapons units equip when forming unions.
Weapons also have <1be0ffbe34ff>attack strength<1ce0>, <1be0ffbe34ff>parry rate<1ce0>,<03e01be0ffbe34ff>weight<1ce0>, and <1be0ffbe34ff>damage absorption<1ce0> stats.<03e0>* Attack strength affects the amount of damage dealt.<03e0>* Parry rate affects the likelihood of Critical Triggers.<03e0>* Weight affects the action order.<03e0>* Damage absorption alleviates the HP lost by attacks.<03e0>While not all of these stats display in menus, be mindful<03e0>of units' weapons when forming unions.
Weapons and combat arts all deal <1be0ffbe34ff>slashing<1ce0>, <1be0ffbe34ff>bludgeoning<1ce0>,<03e01be0ffbe34ff>mauling<1ce0>, or <1be0ffbe34ff>piercing damage<1ce0>.<03e0>These attributes can add to the damage dealt to a target.
If a union's leader falls in battle, it is a <1be0ffbe34ff>Botch<1ce0>.<03e0>Afterwards, <1be0ff4060ff>that union can no longer accept battle<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>commands<1ce0>, meaning the remaining members<03e0>cannot be commanded.
If a unit has a single one-handed weapon equipped,<03e0>it may also equip a shield. Shields are beneficial<03e0>for <1be0ff4060ff>evading attacks<1ce0>.
When a unit continues to engage and defeat enemies,<03e0>a <1be0ffbe34ff>battle chain<1ce0> is formed. As chains become higher,<03e0>player units grow at a faster rate. Getting ambushed<03e0>or returning to the World Map will break the chain.
A count is kept of the <1be0ffbe34ff>number of enemy units<1ce003e01be0ffbe34ff>defeated per battle<1ce0>. As this count rises, the amount<03e0>and quality of loot dropped by the monsters rises as well.
* <1be0ffbe34ff>Necklaces<1ce0> tend to raise mystic defense.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Rings<1ce0> tend to raise intellect.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Bracelets<1ce0> tend to raise HP.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Earrings<1ce0> tend to raise physical defense.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Belts<1ce0> tend to raise strength.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Anklets<1ce0> tend to raise speed.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Amulets<1ce0> tend to raise AP.
Gems<1ce0> are special types of accessories<03e0>granting benefits like no other.
Sometimes after defeating a monster, you may capture<03e0>it, and the option is given to split it into component<03e0>items. Alternately, monsters may be sold intact to<03e0>shops for a high price. Choose to split or not depending<03e0>on your need.
Selling captured monsters to shops increases your<03e01be0ffbe34ff>commerce points<1ce0>. Once your commerce points<03e0>have reached a certain level, shops will begin offering<03e01be0ffbe34ff>trade goods<1ce0>.
Certain items gained by harvesting or defeating<03e0>monsters are known as <1be0ffbe34ff>components<1ce0>. Components<03e0>can be used at customization shops to enhance<03e0>or create new equipment. Some components may<03e0>also be purchased.
Components can be gained by splitting captured<03e0>monsters for parts. In fact, some components can<03e0>only be obtained in this manner. Moving the cursor<03e0>over captured monsters on the battle results screen<03e0>will show what items would be gained upon splitting them.
Some components can be gained by disassembling<03e0>weapons at customization shops. In fact, some<03e0>components can only be obtained in this manner.<03e0>Moving the cursor over the equipment while in the<03e0>customization shop menu will show what items<03e0>would be gained upon disassembling it.
Some monsters will not drop components until<03e0>you have acquired certain rare items.
Each unit has its own <1be0ffbe34ff>stats<1ce007f0>Strength, Intellect, and Speed.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Strength<1ce0> affects physical attack and defense.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Intellect<1ce0> affects mystic attack and defense.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Speed<1ce0> affects action order and evasion.<03e0>Each unit's stats affect the performance of the<03e0>whole union, so keep them in mind.
Units improve their stats by participating in battles.<03e0>Harsher monsters give players bigger boosts.
Each character has his own unique stat. Even if it seems<03e0>to be useless at first glance, the time may come when it<03e0>has a significant effect.
Performance in battle affects units' morale. As one<03e0>might expect, high morale increases performance,<03e0>while units with low morale are not as effective.<03e0>The morale of both the friendly and enemy forces<03e0>is displayed across the top of the screen.
If a Critical Offense is successful as part of a <1be0ffbe34ff>combo<1ce0>,<03e0>the next player unit to act is bumped up to the next<03e0>action, and will also be granted a Critical Offense.<03e0>Additionally, the attack of the final unit to act in that<03e0>union will deal a critical hit.
When a targeted unit successfully blocks an attack<03e0>with a weapon, the damage it would have received<03e0>is completely nullified. Sometimes, the Critical Defense<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Parry<1ce0> is performed, not only nullifying damage but<03e0>inflicting Blacked Out status on the attacker.
When a unit successfully blocks an attack with a<03e0>shield, the damage it would have received is<03e0>completely nullified. Sometimes, the Critical<03e0>Defense <1be0ffbe34ff>Shield Bash<1ce0> is performed, not only<03e0>nullifying damage but inflicting damage on the<03e0>attacker.
When a unit successfully dodges an attack, the<03e0>damage it would have received is completely<03e0>nullified. Sometimes, the Critical Defense<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Counterattack<1ce0> is performed, not only<03e0>nullifying damage, but inflicting damage on the<03e0>attacker.
* When a unit is <1be0ffbe34ff>Blacked Out<1ce0>, <03e0>  it cannot act or react until the turn ends.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Petrification<1ce0> means the unit is turning to stone.<03e0>  Each damaging attack has a chance to cause KO.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Shocked<1ce0> units have 0 defense against<03e0>  thunder and do not get Critical Triggers.
* <1be0ffbe34ff>Burned<1ce0> units have 0 defense against fire,<03e0>  and always act last.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Frozen<1ce0> units have 0 defense against ice,<03e0>  and do not get extra attacks.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Acid Burn<1ce0> units have 0 defense against poison,<03e0>  and their Special Defense falls to 0.
* Units blessed with <1be0ffbe34ff>Protection<1ce003e0>  are surrounded by a wall of mystic energy, fully<03e0>  blocking 1 physical attack.<03e0>* Units covered by an <1be0ffbe34ff>Orphic Ward<1ce003e0>  are surrounded by a wall of mystic energy, fully<03e0>  blocking 1 mystic attack.
* Units with the status <1be0ffbe34ff>Phys Eater<1ce003e0>  absorb as HP all physical damage received<03e0>  for a set number of turns.<03e0>* Units with the status <1be0ffbe34ff>Mystic Eater<1ce003e0>  absorb as HP all mystic damage received<03e0>  for a set number of turns.
* <1be0ffbe34ff>Paralyzed<1ce0> unions are blocked from using<03e0>  combat arts for a set number of turns.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Silenced<1ce0> unions are blocked from using<03e0>  mystic arts for a set number of turns.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Poisoned<1ce0> unions lose a percentage<03e0>  of HP after each unit's turn.
* <1be0ffbe34ff>Cursed<1ce0> unions have the chance of<03e0>  instant death before each unit's action.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Enthralled<1ce0> unions are ensorcelled to mistake<03e0>  friend for foe, and thus attack the wrong side<03e0>  until the end of battle.
* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>Decoy<1ce0> status<03e0>  attract all enemy attention<07f0>and attacks.<03e0>* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>Stealth<1ce0> status<03e0>  cannot be caught in Deadlock.
* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>Charge Up<1ce0> status<03e0>  receive an additional amount of AP each turn.<03e0>* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>Charge Down<1ce0> status<03e0>  receive a reduced amount of AP each turn.
* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>STR Up<1ce0>, <1be0ffbe34ff>INT Up<1ce0>, or<03e0>  <1be0ffbe34ff>SPD Up<1ce0> statuses receive boosts to stats.<03e0>* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>STR Down<1ce0>, <1be0ffbe34ff>INT Down<1ce0>, or<03e0>  <1be0ffbe34ff>SPD Down<1ce0> statuses receive cuts to stats.
* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>ATK Up<1ce0>, <1be0ffbe34ff>DEF Up<1ce0>, or<03e0>  <1be0ffbe34ff>Evasion Up<1ce0> statuses receive boosts to those stats.<03e0>* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>ATK Down<1ce0>, <1be0ffbe34ff>DEF Down<1ce0>, or<03e0>  <1be0ffbe34ff>Evasion Down<1ce0> statuses receive cuts to those stats.
By befriending the mysterious being Mr. Diggs, you<03e0>may use harvesting points to get components useful<03e0>for customization. Try taking Mr. Diggs to many<03e0>places to see what you can find.
The components that can be harvested differ<03e0>according to the type of harvesting point.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Digging Points<1ce0> have rocks, ore, and gems.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Felling Points<1ce0> have trees and flowers.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Underwater Diving Points<1ce0> have precious metals.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Underground Diving Points<1ce0> have natural resources<03e0>  such as water or oil.
Sometimes, special harvest points appear on the map.<03e0>These locations are rumored to have <1be0ffbe34ff>buried treasure<1ce0>.<03e0>The items found here are especially rare. However,<03e0>you can only make one attempt to retrieve them.
Unnaturally good at harvesting items, and almost<03e0>definitely alive, <1be0ffbe34ff>Mr. Diggs<1ce0> can become even better<03e0>at harvesting through practice. The more it tries,<03e0>the more and better quality items it can retrieve.
The number of times Mr. Diggs can harvest is<03e0>displayed as the <1be0ffbe34ff>Digs Count<1ce0>.<03e0>This number can be increased by possessing certain<03e0>items. The count is reset on returning to the World Map<03e0>so feel free to harvest freely.
During harvesting, a <1be0ffbe34ff>Loop Chance<1ce0> may occur<07f003e0>a rare happening when Mr. Diggs's true abilities are<03e0>unlocked, and it harvests to the best of its abilities,<03e0>sometimes finding huge treasure troves. With luck,<03e0>you could find yourself with more items than you<03e0>even know what to do with.
Sometimes, odd things happen to Mr. Diggs, putting you<03e0>on <1be0ffbe34ff>alert<1ce0>. Anything could happen...<03e0>* Rush is covered in a Terrify Aura<03e0>* Rush is covered in a Charm Aura<03e0>* Rush is covered in a Provoke Aura<03e0>* Mr. Diggs's action count goes to minimum<03e0>* Mr. Diggs's action count is restored<03e0>* Nearby monsters are angered
A monster's status can be determined by<03e0>checking the icon above its head.<03e0>Pressing <28e0>722<0000f7>ÿ<000100> left and right calls up<03e0>the target cursor. Placing the target cursor over<03e0>a monster will show its name and stats.
Monsters have three states. You can determine a<03e0>monster's attitude by checking the icon above its head.<03e0>Monsters with <28e0>+**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>0**<d9fffe>ÿ<000100> will flee when you get close.<03e0>Monsters with <28e0>+**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>/**<d8fffe>ÿ<000100> will attack when you get close.<03e0>Monsters with <28e0>+**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>A*<1500daff080000000100> seem calm, but if you get too<03e0>close, who knows what they'll do?
Monsters with <28e0>+**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>2**<d6fffe>ÿ<000100> are completely enraged.<03e0>They will attack you.<03e0>Monsters with <28e0>+**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>,**<dafffe>ÿ<000100> are charmed by Rush.<03e0>They will not attack.<03e0>Monsters in either of these states will follow Rush<03e0>anywhere.
Around the world are incredibly strong beasts who<03e0>are known for their exceptional strength.<03e0>Sometimes it's difficult to tell them from average<03e0>monsters, but if you check their status with your<03e0>target cursor, their name appears in a different<03e0>color than usual<07f0>so beware!
Press <28e03e00>@ <f6>ÿ<00f6ff0100> to Timeshift, slowing the flow<03e0>of time for a short while. When in Timeshift, nearby<03e0>monsters will be marked as encounterable.<03e0>Pulling <28e0>?@ <f6>ÿ<00f6ff0100> while in Timeshift<03e0>will launch a battle with all marked monsters, even<03e0>if the marked monsters are currently out of range.
If you have not pulled <28e0>?@ <f6>ÿ<00f6ff0100> by the end of Timeshift,<03e0>monsters will attack you. <03e028e0>+**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>2**<d6fffe>ÿ<000100> means the monsters are completely<03e0>enraged, and will chase Rush anywhere.
After a Timeshift, Rush cannot Timeshift again<03e0>until the Timeshift gauge is restored.<03e0>If a battle is initiated while in Timeshift,<03e0>the gauge will be fully restored afterwards.
When in towns or on the field, the auto-camera may<03e0>be adjusted to two different levels with <28e0>722<0000f7>ÿ<000100>.<03e0>Additionally, auto-follow can be turned off, and you<03e0>may adjust the viewing angle as you like. This can be<03e0>switched through the Config menu.
Enemies or NPCs may be targeted by scrolling left and right<03e0>on <28e0>722<0000fd>ÿ<000100>. You can also switch targets this way.<03e0>Lock onto a target with <28e0>=@ <f6>ÿ<00f6ff0100>, to keep them at the<03e0>center of the screen.
During battle, while entering commands, the viewpoint<03e0>can be changed with <28e0>@  <0000000000000100>.
By pressing <28e0>?@ <f6>ÿ<00f6ff0100>, monsters within<03e0>a certain range can be drawn into battle.<03e0>Monsters with icons <28e0>-**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>C**<0000fa>ÿ<000100> above their heads<03e0>are close enough to be encountered.
If a monster on the field attacks you before you have<03e0>a chance to attack it, <1be0ff4060ff>you will be at a distinct<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>disadvantage<1ce0> in the ensuing battle. Be forewarned.
Pulling <28e0>?@ <f6>ÿ<00f6ff0100> when there are no monsters<03e0>in range launches an <1be0ffbe34ff>Aggro Pull<1ce0>.<03e0>Aggro Pulling the enemy makes them angry.<03e028e0>+**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>2**<d6fffe>ÿ<000100> means the monsters are completely<03e0>enraged, and will chase Rush anywhere.
Monsters that have seen Rush may bring nearby<03e0>monsters into battle with them. This is called a <1be0ffbe34ff>link<1ce0>.<03e0>The more monsters linked into one battle,<03e0>the better the chances to earn rewards.
Finding a map allows you to check your current position.<03e0>Press <28e0>:  <0000000000000100> to display the map.
While selling items, <1be0ff4060ff>press <28e0>:  <0000000000000100> at the shop list<1ce0> to <1be0ff4060ff>sell<03e0>in bulk<1ce0>. Place your cursor over the item you wish to<03e0>bulk sell, then check it on or off with <28e0>:  <0000000000000100>.<03e0>Press <28e0>8  <0000000000000100> to sell everything you've checked.<03e028e0>9  <0000000000000100> will clear all checks.
While choosing battle commands, <1be0ff4060ff>press <28e0>:  <0000000000000100> to<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>display the unit status<1ce0>.<03e0>This will show the actions each unit will perform<03e0>for the selected command.
Pressing <28e0>9  <0000000000000100> will speed the process<03e0>of the display on the battle results screen.
On menus with scrollbars, pressing <28e0>722<0000f7>ÿ<000100> up or down<03e0>while holding <28e0>;  <0000000000000100> will skip the text by a page at a time.
While in towns, pressing <28e01c00>  <0000000000000100> will return you to the City Map.<03e0>Pressing <28e01c00>  <0000000000000100> a second time will call up the World Map.
Pubs<1ce0> are a great source of information on<03e0>happenings in the world. Even the smallest of<03e0>villages has a pub, a clearinghouse for the latest<03e0>news. <1be0ff4060ff>When in doubt, first speak with the bartender.<1ce003e0>Many characters offering quests gather in pubs.
When you don't have enough members in your party,<03e0>try hiring some muscle at a <1be0ffbe34ff>guild<1ce0>.<03e0>As you progress through the game, stronger and<03e0>more varied mercenaries will become available.
Guild Tasks<1ce0> are completely optional quests.<03e0>All that's needed is to fulfill the conditions for<03e0>them to be completed. Check the task list at guilds<03e0>for more information.
After battle, sometimes friendly units want the spoils<03e0>of your last battle. They do not claim items at<03e0>random, but <1be0ff4060ff>search for items to customize their<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>equipment<1ce0>. If you give them the items, they will<03e0>have better gear.
When a new union enters the battlefield, the side<03e0>it is supporting is <1be0ffbe34ff>Reinforced<1ce0>. Reinforcement<03e0>may correspond to anything from a large linked<03e0>battle, or the effects of an enemy skill.
Interference<1ce0> is a state in which the player union or<03e0>an ally union forces an enemy union, which has a different<03e0>union targeted for Deadlock, into a Deadlock.<03e0>This is called <1be0ffbe34ff>Interception<1ce0> when done by an enemy union<03e0>to the player union or an ally union.
The game can generally be saved anywhere<03e0>the Party Menu can be opened.<03e0>Game progress can also be saved on<03e0>World and City Maps.
Questgivers are generally found in pubs.<03e0>Talk to the pub staff to hear the latest<03e0>rumors surrounding currently available quests.<03e0>Different rumors can be heard in different towns.
When specific characters join your party,<03e0>you can find and talk to them when visiting<03e0>their hometowns. The conversations you<03e0>have change the more you talk to them<03e0>and help them out.
Even if given the same battle command,<03e0>depending on the unit, the action it<03e0>takes may differ. It is up to you whether<03e0>to place emphasis on the unit or the action<03e0>in question.
Unleashing a Remnant's power or summoning<03e0>a Remnant using Arcana can be done through<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Special Commands<1ce0>. This command appears when<03e0>fighting tough opponents, or when you have<03e0>lots of morale during battle, for example.
Spells referred to as <1be0ffbe34ff>Arcana<1ce0> can be<03e0>unleashed when several units' spells get released<03e0>together. Once an Arcana spell is unleashed,<03e0>it will appear as an option in the Special Commands.

My wife has been gone for ages.<03e0>She's most likely gone to see the Liafort again.<04e0>She does this to me all the time.
Young man, might I ask a favor?<03e0>My wife has wandered off to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Ivory Peaks<1ce0>.<03e0>Bring her back and I will reward you.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, why not?<09e008e0010000000300>Nah, sounds like a hassle.
Thank you, young man. Off you go.
Hmph.
I ask you again.<03e0>My wife has wandered off to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Ivory Peaks<1ce0>.<03e0>Bring her back and I will reward you.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, why not?<09e008e0010000000300>Nah, sounds like a hassle.
Thank you, young man. Off you go.
Hmph.
Well?<03e0>I see you haven't found her yet.<06e0000008e0000000000000>I was just about to go get her.<09e008e0010000000300>Calm down. Maybe later.
Why are you still here?<03e0>Off you go!
What a rude young man you are!<03e0>Off with you!
Thank you. Violet has finally returned to me.<03e0>...Although she's kept herself locked in her room<03e0>since she came back.<04e0>I understand her frustration regarding her family's<03e0>situation, but she must understand that no dynasty<03e0>lasts forever.<04e0>Enough of my ramblings.<03e0>Here is your promised reward.
Till we meet again.

Violet, let's return to Celapaleis.<03e0>Your husband is sure to have sent some goons after you.
Gabriel, I don't know what to do.<03e0>The Gilles-Barre family treasure was taken and<03e0>now stands surrounded by filthy monsters!
Calm down, Violet.<03e0>The Liafort's grandeur is still as apparent as before.
Who's there?
He sent you, didn't he?
I didn't expect such a large party.
The Gilles-Barres used to own this area,<03e0>but as soon as it came under Celapaleis's rule,<03e0>the land quickly began to decline.<04e0>Many moved to Celapaleis.<03e0>The Duke of Qubine forced me to wed Nielsen<03e0>in hopes of destroying my family name.
I will not let anyone sully the Gilles-Barre<03e0>name! And I will not remain married<03e0>to that pompous fool!
Violet, I know why you do this.<03e0>But you have to take action a different way.
I know you understand me.<03e0>But why do you always stop me<03e0>from doing what I think is right?
I'm just worried about you.<03e0>Let's return to Celapaleis for now.
...
You're right. Let's go back.

My wife has disappeared again.<03e0>I have a bad feeling this time, though...<04e0>I know she's been seeing that man,<03e0>I just hope he's not using her.<03e0>Or filling her head with nonsense.
Ah, young man.<03e0>I believe I know where my wife is.<03e0>Will you check up on her for me?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure.<09e008e0010000000300>Why? She's fine.
She's in the depths of the <1be0ffbe34ff>Gaslin Caves<1ce0>.<03e0>You must hurry.
How can you say that!?
My wife, Violet, is missing.<03e0>I hope nothing bad has happened to her.<03e0>Can you go check on her for me?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure.<09e008e0010000000300>Why? She's fine.

She's in the depths of the <1be0ffbe34ff>Gaslin Caves<1ce0>.<03e0>You must hurry.
You are the laziest young man I've ever met!
The Duke of Qubine handled things<03e0>quite impressively, even in the face<03e0>of danger.
Violet and I have been conversing more and more.<03e0>She frequently leaves the house, though.<04e0>If you see her around, treat her kindly.<04e0>This is just a token of my appreciation.<03e0>Take it.
There's a very exclusive guild behind<03e0>the pub. I'll be sure to put in a good<03e0>word for you.<04e0>I can't thank you enough for helping me.

"Of course"? You don't even know what happened!
My apologies.<03e0>Let me fill you in.
Violet is planning something horrible.<03e0>She's going to assassinate the Duke of Qubine.<04e0>I love her.<03e0>I know what the situation is with her family.<03e0>How could I have stopped her?<04e0>I suggested a rumor of his assassination would suffice,<03e0>but she wouldn't listen.<04e0>I know where she's gone.<03e0>Will you help me stop her?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, I'm game.<09e008e0010000000300>Nah, she won't do it anyway.

Violet Gilles-Barre Nielsen.<03e0>You have done Celapaleis well.<04e0>You risked your life to defend Celapaleis<03e0>and I cannot express enough gratitude<03e0>for your actions.
Wh-what do you mean?
Violet, your actions will be forever<03e0>carved in the history of Celapaleis.<04e0>The Gilles-Barre name will never be forgotten.
I... Duke Qubine...
I know that you were very little when your homeland<03e0>was taken from you. You must have thought it barbaric.<04e0>However, the Gilles-Barres were on the verge of<03e0>being no more, for economic and militaristic reasons.<03e0>They had no choice but to be taken in by Celapaleis.<04e0>Your father trusted me with everything<07f003e0>the Gilles-Barre history, its honor, your happiness...

I'm to meet with my beloved, but she has<03e0>baffled me with the meeting place she's decided...
<1be0ffbe34ff>Mojcado Castle<1ce0>...
It's an ancient castle left to ruin. Now it's only<03e0>home to legions of monsters and beasts.<04e0>Why in the world would she select such a<03e0>dangerous place to meet? No matter how I try,<03e0>I cannot make heads or tails of the decision.
Nevertheless, I will go. To meet with Charlotte,<03e0>I would walk through a raging battlefield for<03e0>just a glimpse of her smile.<04e0>That said, I am no fighter. Good sir, might I<03e0>request your assistance as a bodyguard within<03e0>these ruins?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, I'll come along.<09e008e0010000000300>Be a man. Go it alone.
You've my gratitude. I am Paris. Not to be overly<03e0>single-minded, but let us hurry to <1be0ffbe34ff>Mojcado Castle<1ce0>.
Oh... I see...
I've taken Charlotte home safe and sound.<03e0>I cannot thank you enough for your help.
Here is your promised reward.<03e0>Please, take it.
My beloved has bid me meet her within a monster's<03e0>lair. Would you assist me in making my way through<03e0>the ruins?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Okay, fine.<09e008e0010000000300>I don't play third wheel.
You've my gratitude. I am Paris. Not to be overly<03e0>single-minded, but let us hurry to <1be0ffbe34ff>Mojcado Castle<1ce0>.
Oh... I see...
I trust you have remembered your promise to go with<03e0>me to the ruined castle... If your preparations are<03e0>complete, let us be off.<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm ready to go!<09e008e0010000000300>Just need another minute.
Thank you!
Please hurry.<03e0>Charlotte is in danger!

Would my Charlotte really have come to such a place?
Aughhhh!!!
That voice<07f0>it's Charlotte!<03e0>Something must have happened to her!
I was meant to meet Charlotte at the castle's bell tower.
Let's hurry!
Aughhhh!!!
That's not the right way!

Where could they have taken Charlotte?
There must be a key.<03e0>Let us search for it.

Lord Paris! Time to die!
I was waiting for you when that wretch suddenly<03e0>attacked me... I was terrified...
Thank you, Rush.<03e0>Words cannot fully convey my gratitude.
But, dearest Charlotte, why did you decide to<03e0>meet in such a perilous location in the first<03e0>place?<04e0>Though thanks to me requesting Rush's help,<03e0>we were able to rescue you...
What do you mean? Paris, you were the one who<03e0>decided the meeting place. You wrote me not a<03e0>fortnight back.
What!? I never wrote such a letter.
Wh-what!?
What manner of knavery is this<07f0>and towards<03e0>what end?<04e0>Now that I think of it... The brute from earlier<03e0>knew me by name. Certainly it could not have<03e0>been<07f001e00be00ae0>
*sigh*<03e0>Forgive me, Rush. This mystery does not<03e0>preclude a reward for your assistance.
Aughhhh!!!

Where could Charlotte have been taken?
There must be a key.<03e0>We must find it!

Rush! It's been quite a while.<03e0>I have another favor to ask of you.
East of Balterossa, deep below the Great Sand Sea,<03e0>lives a very kind old seer.<04e0>Charlotte and I would appreciate it if you would<03e0>escort us to him.<06e0000008e0000000000000>No prob!<09e008e0010000000300>I'm kinda busy...
I hate to involve you in our personal intrigues<03e0>yet again, but you have my gratitude.<04e0>Our parents refuse to acknowledge our love.<03e0>Throughout the time we've been kept apart,<03e0>we've communicated in secret.<04e0>But now...we are tired of all this cloak-and-dagger<07f003e0>keeping our true feelings in the shadows, as if<03e0>we are shamed by such a thing!
We've decided to elope.<04e0>The seer has agreed to keep us for a short time.<03e0>Afterwards, we'll flee to some place far<07f003e0>somewhere we may be together.
Let us make our way to <1be0ffbe34ff>the Great Subterrane<1ce0>.<03e0>You are the only man I can trust, Rush...<03e0>Know that I appreciate this.
Understood.<03e0>Then return when you've finished your tasks.<03e0>I shall be waiting.
Was all that happened just a product of the seer's<03e0>machinations? I...I do not know... I've nothing left<03e0>to believe in...<04e0>...At the very least, it's due to your assistance<03e0>that Charlotte is unharmed, Rush. My heart was<03e0>the only casualty...
Forgive me, my mind wanders.<03e0>Here, a small token of my gratitude.
They say that given enough time, a broken<03e0>heart becomes inured to the pain...<03e0>I suppose all I can do is wait...
There is a seer that lives beneath the Great<03e0>Sand Sea. Charlotte and I ask that you<03e0>escort us to him.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Okey-doke!<09e008e0010000000300>I'm still busy...

You have my thanks.
You are the only one I can depend on, Rush!

The seer lives further within.<03e0>It should be a simple matter to hide out<03e0>for a while in a place like this...
Paris...wait, please.<04e0>I...I'm worried, Paris. Is running away like this<03e0>truly the right thing for us to do?
Charlotte, what's come over you all of a sudden?<03e0>This was your idea to begin with!
I know...<03e0>And I deeply believe as the seer says,<03e0>that with you I will find true happiness.<04e0>But...<03e0>But still, Paris...<04e0>What about Mother? Will she be able to<03e0>share in our joy? Or will it be the opposite?<03e0>What of your father?
There is no need to worry...
Who's there?
By ridding the world of the two of you,<03e0>our organization will be able to spread joy<03e0>to many, many people.
Augh!
Charlotte!?<04e0>That voice<07f0>that's the seer...<06e0000008e0000000000000>We've gotta go after 'em!<09e008e0010000000000>What'll we do?
Right! Thank you.<03e0>The seer's home is further in.<03e0>We must hurry and save Charlotte!

Seer! You've done so much for us... How could you<03e0>betray our trust so? What is the meaning of this?
Hmph.<03e0>There is no need for me to explain.
All I'll have to explain is how I found the two<03e0>of you<07f0>victims of lovers' suicide!
Charlotte! Are you unharmed?
Yes, I'm fine.
Paris...I'm sorry, I can't do this.<03e0>I tried, but...I need to be at Mother's side.
Why? <07f0>You believe that the times we spent<03e0>together<07f0>the feelings we shared<07f0>were nothing<03e0>more than illusions created by the seer?
Of course not.<03e0>I know that can't be true, I can feel it...<04e0>I just<07f0>I can't...
I...I see...<03e0>...It's alright. I knew that someday, we would<03e0>have to face the cruel truth of our situation.<04e0>I only hoped our borrowed time would have lasted<03e0>longer...
Paris<07f0> I still<07f001e00be00ae0>

Sir Rush...<03e0>Might I have your ear for a moment?<04e0>It really seems as if Balterossa and Royotia shall go to<03e0>war. Already we strengthen our armies...
For a long time, Royotia has tried to build its<03e0>own trade routes, independent of Balterossa's<03e0>involvement.<04e0>But Mother is strongly opposed to this.<04e0>Royotia seems blind to the trials of not only<03e0>creating a major trade route, but protecting it<03e0>from bandits and beasts who would attack it.<04e0>For them to even attempt to enforce a level of<03e0>security on the road would take countless lives.<04e0>Yet through the blessing of the Tao Tie,<03e0>Balterossa can and has kept the Great Sand Sea<03e0>under control for years.<04e0>I agree with Mother... It is best for everyone<03e0>if Royotia continues to use our roads.<04e0>But Royotia refuses to accept this, and guerilla<03e0>insurgency in Balterossa has spread...<03e0>Mother is certain it is officially sponsored.<04e0>But, to go to war with Royotia without any solid<03e0>evidence...
Tell me, Rush.<03e0>Is this war truly necessary?<03e0>Will no one try to stop it?<06e0000008e0000000000000>There might be one guy...<09e008e0010000000000>It sucks, but nope.
Oh<07f0>Paris...<03e0>Yes, if he... If we can<07f004e0>Sir Rush...<03e0>Will you assist me in a task?<03e0>I need to stop this war!<06e0000008e0000000000000>Don't gotta ask me twice!<09e008e0010000000300>Like I can stop a war...
Thank you so much. Yes...I shall go to <1be0ffbe34ff>Royotia<1ce0>!<03e0>Paris is the son of the Marquis. Surely he can<03e0>do something!
No...I cannot believe it!
No<07f0>I cannot accept that!
Sir Rush! Thank you for all your help.<04e0>Mother and Lord Priam listened to our pleas.<03e0>They have agreed to end the fighting.<04e0>However, she refuses to even discuss the issue of the<03e0>conspirators. It seems that whoever was behind all this<03e0>will remain unknown.<04e0>Relations between nations are naught but a clumsy<03e0>dance of interactions complicated by countless outside<03e0>influences... Truly, politics is a trying thing.<04e0>Still, I am very thankful to Mother as well as<03e0>Lord Priam for reaching a compromise.
I would like you to have this.
Now I shall bid you leave. If you are ever again in<03e0>Balterossa, I am your humble servant.<04e0>Paris has also sworn to help you if you are ever in<03e0>need of a swordsman. But...<04e0>Do not let him face too much danger, if you please...<03e0>I would be rather vexed if he returns in more than one<03e0>piece.

Well met, Rush Sykes.<03e0>My son has told me a lot about you...<04e0>Good things, don't worry! It seems that you've<03e0>helped him out of many a pinch.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Right. About that war...<09e008e0010000000000>Where's Charlotte?
Royotia is continually robbed of the profits it<03e0>rightly deserves by Balterossa's exploitation.<04e0>Ending that cycle and gaining control of her<03e0>own trade routes is my country's greatest wish.<04e0>Yet that woman ignores our rights on baseless<03e0>whim, and instead blames us for her own<03e0>security problems.<04e0>It's as if she wishes to bring us to war!<04e0>And if that is so, we shall show her what the<03e0>men of Royotia are made of. We shall establish<03e0>our routes, and if we must fight, then so be it.
That's the Duchess's daughter, isn't it<07f0>the one<03e0>plotting to hoodwink my son?<04e0>As if I would know her location. The strumpet can<03e0>die in the gutter for all I care.<04e0>More importantly, might you have an idea as to<03e0>where Paris could have gotten off to? We're on<03e0>the cusp of war, and he's disappeared...<04e007f0>Surely he hasn't gone to meet that trollop?<03e0>He knows that <1be0ffbe34ff>Lavafender<1ce0> is too dangerous<03e0>right now!
Rush. Thanks to you and my son, we suffered much<03e0>fewer losses than I'd feared.<04e0>Still, Paris still has a lot to learn about politics. He still<03e0>seems a bit awkward with these matters of state.
Thank you, Rush.<03e0>If you ever need my help, ask for me at the<03e0>guild hall. I shall do all I can.
Master Paris and Lady Charlotte are still very young.<03e0>I fear they will suffer many hardships in the future...
The relationship between countries is very much<03e0>affected by the countries that surround them.
It seemed like the Balterossan army suffered heavy<03e0>losses.

Priam...that despicable whoreson.<03e0>Using such underhanded tactics to sully the<03e0>name of Balterossa...<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah. About that...<09e008e0010000000000>Wait, where's Paris?
Guaranteeing the safety of routes through the Great<03e0>Sand Sea is a duty Balterossa has taken of her own<03e0>accord, and not without sacrifice.<04e0>Slandering our country as if those sacrifices meant<03e0>nothing... Moreover, claiming hegemony over the Great<03e0>Sand Sea<07f0>I can think of no act more vile!<04e0>Balterossa has been the guardian of the desert for a<03e0>thousand years. It seems it is necessary to remind the<03e0>world of the reason for that.
If you mean the base cur who has deceived my<03e0>beloved daughter, I have no desire to know where<03e0>he is.<04e0>I'm sure he is lurking somewhere, plotting to take<03e0>advantage of Charlotte's innocence.<04e0>Though, as you mention it, I have not seen her in a<03e0>while... Where could she be during such a crisis?<04e0>She...surely she could not have gone to Royotia...<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Lavafender<1ce0> is incredibly dangerous!
In the end the incident came to a...touching conclusion.<03e0>Certainly, using the two of them required more than a<03e0>little care.<04e0>Nevertheless, in the end it became a good bargaining<03e0>chip.
Did you hear?<03e0>Mother has allowed Paris and I to court!
Sir Paris will be the next Marquis of Royotia. I can't<03e0>begin to imagine the pressure Lady Charlotte faces.
Sometimes I believe ignorance really is bliss...<03e0>Especially in things political...
It seems the Royotian Guard suffered many losses.

Sir Rush! I was able to meet Paris!<03e0>He is willing to help me stop this war...
Charlotte, we haven't much time.<03e0>We must bring Rush up to speed...
Oh, yes!
After our incident with the seer, I returned<03e0>to investigate his home. There I found some<03e0>letters outlining a plot...<04e0>It was to induce Royotia and Balterossa to<03e0>deploy their armies, and then use a legion of<03e0>monsters to completely destroy both forces.<04e0>The letters were coded, their true content hidden<03e0>in innocuous-looking phrases, so it took some<03e0>time to decrypt the message.
Someone was trying to manipulate our<03e0>countries into war. Mother and Paris's father<03e0>both fell for their tricks...
They took advantage of both our relationship,<03e0>and Father and the Duchess's distrust of each<03e0>other. To think we were all played so easily...
Paris...
Both Royotia and Balterossa are in great danger.<03e0>However, we cannot approach both at once. Where<03e0>should we stop them from?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Off to Balterossa!<09e008e0010000000000>Off to Royotia!
We should start in Balterossa, then. They are fighting at<03e0>a battleground known as the <1be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Tongue<1ce0>.<04e0>Of course, afterwards we should save the Royotians as<03e0>well. Either way, time is of the essence.
We should head to Royotia first, yes? The troops are<03e0>making their stand at the <1be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Belly<1ce0>.<04e0>Let us hurry, so that we may save the Balterossans as<03e0>well!
Paris, is that truly alright? The Royotian Guard is also<03e0>under attack by monsters!
I know. Let's hurry to save them!<04e0>To the <1be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Belly<1ce0>!
Then it's off to help the Balterossan army.<03e0>There's no time to lose!
Please, Paris, Sir Rush, save the Balterossans!<04e0>They are at a place called the <1be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Tongue<1ce0>!
The beasts have fled.<03e0>And both forces have withdrawn.<04e0>There were casualties, but thankfully,<03e0>major losses were avoided.
The world is so agitated that it even doubts<03e0>the power of Remnants... Why must something<03e0>like this bring us to war?
Charlotte...all hope is not lost.<03e0>There is still something we can do...<03e0>Something only we can do.<04e0>Together, we can bring many people happiness.
Paris...<04e0>But... All I've done is hurt you.<03e0>After that, how could you still want me?
Oh Charlotte...<03e0>The pain you caused me was like someone taking a<03e0>fiery dagger to my heart.<04e0>Yet through that searing pain, I felt a sweet melancholy,<03e0>as if the instrument of torture branding my heart was<03e0>soaked with tears...<04e0>Tears you yourself had shed from the brutal memories<03e0>of causing such anguish to your one true love.<04e0>I loved you enough to let you go... Such emotion is<03e0>not easily forgotten. I only dream that a fraction of<03e0>this love is returned.
Paris...<03e0>Yes. Always.
Then... I must win over my pig-headed father!
Yes, and I will tell Mother...<03e0>Somehow, I'll make her understand!
Sir Rush, come to the tavern later, alright?<03e0>I'll have something for you!

I am Roberto, commander of an order of<03e0>knights in this region, the Order of Melphina.<04e0>From your bearing, I see you must be an<03e0>accomplished adventurer. With that the case,<03e0>I would make a request of you.
To the northwest of this town lies the cursed<03e0>bog, <1be0ffbe34ff>Crookfen<1ce0>. For long years its evil has been<03e0>sealed by a Remnant.<04e0>Yet of late, the Remnant's seal fails, siring<03e0>monsters from the flow of dark power.
At once, we of the Order sent scouts to examine<03e0>the seal. None have yet returned.<04e0>Would that I could add others to the search, but<03e0>the town must be defended, and we have no<03e0>men to spare.
So, I ask you<07f0>would you come with me to<03e0>Crookfen and restore the broken seal?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, I'll help out!<09e008e0010000000300>Uhh, can I think about it?
Ohh! To see such a fine and just youth...! You<03e0>honor me with your cooperation.<04e0>Let us head to <1be0ffbe34ff>Crookfen<1ce0> with haste.
No<07f0>you have no need to apologize. I knew the<03e0>folly of such an unreasonable request from the<03e0>start.<04e0>That said, if time bids you change your mind,<03e0>let me know.
Ophelia, calm yourself. Do not forget the place<03e0>of a knight of the Order of Melphina.
Ophelia. The Order is meant to be the<03e0>country's shield, not its blade.<04e0>If you were to abandon the people at a time like<03e0>this, who would protect them?
Life must always be your top priority. Our duty<03e0>now is to find our lost men without further<03e0>delay. This is no time for vengeance.
Ah, Master Sykes. Forgive me.<04e0>This is my subcommander, Ophelia.<03e0>Please excuse our indiscretions just now.
See? Master Sykes agrees.<04e0>Ophelia... With all that's happened, I certainly<03e0>understand your feelings. But this is not the<03e0>time to let passions rule our judgment.
Hmm... Certainly, Master Sykes's opinion does<03e0>have merit...
Oh, yes!<04e0>Master Sykes, take this as a token of our gratitude.
Now we must find our lost knights.<03e0>Truly, where could they be?
Commander, we've waited and waited, but there<03e0>has yet to be any word from our lost men.<04e0>While we've worried about the seal, fiends have<03e0>plotted against us, right under our noses...
But, Commander!<03e0>A group of suspicious characters dressed in<03e0>black was seen leaving Crookfen!
At your leave, I shall depart at once to arrest<03e0>the blackguards and bring them to justice!<03e0>Their evil deeds must be brought to light!
But...!
...
Exactly! Any miscreants who think they can<03e0>deceive the people of Melphina should be<03e0>shown no quarter!
Any miscreants who think they can deceive the<03e0>people of Melphina will receive no mercy!

Welcome to our town. It is small and remote,<03e0>but for academic or mystic studies, there is no<03e0>better place on the continent.
I trust Roberto more than anyone in the world.<03e0>I'd vouch for his skill with a blade with my life.
Roberto. This issue can be discussed further at<03e0>a later time. For now, let us be grateful for<03e0>young Sykes's assistance in restoring the seal.
Valiant youth...<03e0>I too express my gratitude.

We seek the Remnant Last Leaf. Its broken<03e0>seal is surely the source of this wicked wind.
If we can stem the tide of that evil, the prayers<03e0>of the Forest Maidens should reach the Remnant<03e0>and restore the seal.
Time is of the essence. Let us make haste!
We were able to complete the sealing ritual<03e0>without incident.<04e0>Without your assistance, Master Sykes, heaven<03e0>knows what could have happened...
The seal is repaired, yet our wayward comrades<03e0>have yet to be found.<04e0>This weighs heavily on my mind... But for now,<03e0>let us return to Melphina.
The seal seems very strong.
The Remnant's seal is broken!<03e0>You are buffeted by a wave of dark energy!
The wind...the flowers...<03e0>the unceasing flow of water...<04e0>In the name of the Remnant Last Leaf,<03e0>let the wicked souls of the dead be purified<03e0>and return to the heavens...
Rush Sykes.<03e0>I truly thank you.<04e0>The Forest Maidens express the highest gratitude.

Marsha...<03e0>Does this Forest Maiden lend her aid to our<03e0>search for the missing members of the Order?
She does. Meister Olebeag, Sir Roberto, this is<03e0>one of our newest Maidens, Leticia.<04e0>She has very advanced empathic abilities.
Leticia is bound to one of the missing knights<07f003e0>a man named Neo.<04e0>She has attempted to sense his presence since<03e0>the beginning of this ordeal. Finally, she has been<03e0>able to sense something...
Go on, Leticia.<03e0>Describe what you see.
Yes, Mistress.
.........
I see several small, faint lights...<04e0>Plants grow from the stones; they give off<03e0>a beautiful green glow, and there's the sound<03e0>of ever-falling water...
Glowing plants and falling water...<04e0>By the God Emperor! That must be the cavern<03e0>to the southwest<07f01be0ffbe34ff>Siebenbur<1ce0>!
Ah, Master Sykes!<04e0>We have gained a clue as to the whereabouts<03e0>of the lost knights of the Order.
The maid Leticia of the Forest Maidens has seen<03e0>a vision of where our errant knights may be.<04e0>Her description led us believe they must be in<03e0>the great caverns to the southwest...<1be0ffbe34ff>Siebenbur<1ce0>.
I intend to head to <1be0ffbe34ff>Siebenbur<1ce0> to rescue my<03e0>comrades.
I would appreciate it muchly if you would assist<03e0>me, Master Sykes. May I once again call upon<03e0>your blade?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Let's bring 'em home!<09e008e0010000000300>Sorry, I'm a bit busy.
Once again, you honor me with your generosity.<03e0>I am in your debt.<04e0>Let us make preparations and head<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Siebenbur<1ce0> immediately.
No<07f0>you have no need to apologize. I knew the<03e0>folly of such an unreasonable request from the<03e0>start.<04e0>That said, if time bids you change your mind,<03e0>let me know.
Thankfully, all were able to return to Melphina<03e0>safely. This is all due to your assistance,<03e0>Master Sykes. Again, I am in your debt.
Hmm...<04e0>Ophelia, I believe these men in black are just the face<03e0>of a much larger evil<07f0>an organization with command<03e0>over many powerful Remnants.
The henchmen we have dealt with are far from<03e0>the fiends controlling all this.<04e0>If we do not uncover the masterminds behind<03e0>this plot against Melphina, they will only send<03e0>another set of assassins.
Even Master Sykes agrees.<04e0>Ophelia, know that bruised hearts and soiled pride is<03e0>something that the both of us share. Still, this matter<03e0>bids us act with caution, and that cannot be ignored.
Ophelia... The most important thing for us to protect<03e0>is not our reputation.
Oh, yes!<04e0>Master Sykes, take this as a token of our gratitude.
My subcommander is sure of blade, but perhaps oversure<03e0>of judgment... She is still young, and victim to her sense<03e0>of justice at times.
Setting strength against strength will only escalate<03e0>conflict.<04e0>The Order will look into further movements of this<03e0>black-cloaked group. Hopefully this will lead to a<03e0>peaceful resolution.
Still, Commander<07f0>the curs responsible for<03e0>kidnapping our men in the first place have yet<03e0>to be brought to justice.
The tarnished honor of the Order of Melphina<03e0>cries out to be avenged!<04e0>The acts these miscreants have performed are<03e0>unforgivable. Let our punishment be swift and<03e0>unrelenting.
But...but,<03e0>the good name of the Order...!
...
Isn't it, though! If we roll over and let this stand, the<03e0>Order of Melphina will be a laughing stock across the<03e0>continent!
Any miscreants who think they can deceive the<03e0>people of Melphina will receive no mercy!
Any miscreants who think they can deceive the<03e0>people of Melphina will receive no mercy!

Hmm...<03e0>Indeed, that sounds to be the case.
So, you will go with Roberto, will you?<03e0>You truly are a valiant youth.<04e0>You remind me of myself as a child.
Roberto. This issue may be discussed at a later time.<03e0>For now, let us be grateful for young Sykes's assistance<03e0>in rescuing our knights.
Valiant young man...<03e0>For bringing my men from the mouth of danger,<03e0>I give you my thanks.
<1be0ffbe34ff>Siebenbur<1ce0> has long been known as a terribly<03e0>dangerous area.<04e0>Whyever would someone of the Order go to such<03e0>a place?
What a blessing that everyone returned safely...
Oh, Neo...<03e0>Please, please be alright...
Oh, Neo...<03e0>Please, please be alright...
You brought my Neo back home safe...<03e0>Rush, thank you so, so much.
So, the other knights could not use the transport<03e0>Remnant to escape, then?<04e0>There is no need to worry. The power of the Blue Elf<03e0>can reverse the Remnant's actions and send you back.<04e0>Will you return to <1be0ffbe34ff>Siebenbur<1ce0>?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah! Gotta save the others!<09e008e0010000000300>Lemme do something first.
We all depend on you, young Sykes.
Hmm. I do worry for the fate of the Order, but<03e0>there is wisdom in being prepared. Ready yourself<03e0>before returning.

If the maid Leticia's vision was true, the errant<03e0>knights of the Order should be this way.<04e0>Let us make haste!
Ohh... Neo, Vinnery, Lukorra! Are you alright?
Commander Roberto! It's the commander!
Are we saved?
Boss! I was getting real scared...
Commander... On the way to the broken seal,<03e0>some men dressed in black assaulted us.<03e0>When we woke up, we were down here...
Heh... Finally, the Order's commander gets<03e0>around to showing up.
Ah<07f0>him!<03e0>That's one of the men in black who trapped us in here!
Melphina's oh-so-important knightly order is<03e0>done for.
The bridge...<03e0>We...we can't return to Melphina!
Calm yourselves, everyone.
It is said that these caverns have existed since<03e0>the days of the Old Kingdoms...<04e0>They consist of six connecting paths, stretching<03e0>across the continent.<04e0>If we continue this way, surely we'll find a<03e0>location where we may return to the surface.
Whoa there, li'l dogies. I can't just let you go<03e0>around mucking up all my bro's plans!<04e0>You'd better think again if you think you're<03e0>gonna leave here alive! Hypnos...go!
Wha...what the hell is wrong with you people?<03e0>Keep the hell out of our way!
Dammit, what'm I gonna do...<04e0>Okay, strategic withdrawal for now. But I'm<03e0>gonna remember this!
Master Sykes! You've returned!
The transport Remnant is unable to take everyone back.<03e0>It must be a plot of those varlets in black, no doubt.<04e0>It seems we must find a way to escape this prison<03e0>ourselves.

Well met, Sir Rush!<04e0>If you can spare a few moments, I would have you<03e0>meet with Commander Roberto once again.<04e0>Our spate of bad luck seems to have spread further...<03e0>If you would, please, go to the palace!

Neo. Any word from the squad sent to the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Malbourge Flatlands<1ce0>?
Our advance squadron is locked in fierce fighting.<04e0>The number of monsters coming from Crookfen is far<03e0>higher than we'd imagined.
The monster forces are on their way here to<03e0>Melphina!
It's only a matter of time before the vanguard falls.<03e0>We must prepare for battle ourselves, while we still can!
Yes. We must hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Malbourge Flatlands<1ce0>.<03e0>I do not understand this outbreak...<03e0>We performed the sealing not so long ago...
I fear that the sealing Remnant has been<03e0>overpowered by someone who wishes to<03e0>destroy the seal.
Meister Olebeag, Sir Roberto, allow me to go as well.<04e0>If the Remnant's power is out of control, I must repair<03e0>the seal as soon as possible.
Roberto, Marsha, men of the Order...<03e0>Go with grace to your tasks.
Master Sykes!<03e0>The monsters we sealed not long ago have<03e0>suddenly begun respawning.
They have organized a march on Melphina.<03e0>Their numbers are too vast to even compare<03e0>with before.
Currently, I prepare to lead the Order to the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Malbourge Flatlands<1ce0> to stop the wave of beasts.<04e0>If we can do nothing else, the beasts must not<03e0>be allowed to destroy Melphina.
Master Sykes... I am shamed to ask this of<03e0>you so directly, but this is my final request.<03e0>Please, would you help me protect Melphina!?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Of course I'll help!<09e008e0010000000000>Can I think about it?
Master Sykes, you...<03e0>I swear to you, I shall repay this debt!<04e0>Then make haste in your preparations, and let<03e0>us march!<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm ready<07f0>let's roll!<09e008e0010000000300>Okay, gimme a minute.
Master Sykes, let us march!<03e006e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah, let's roll!<09e008e0010000000300>I'm not quite ready yet...
Then, we, the brave men of the Order of<03e0>Melphina, depart for the <1be0ffbe34ff>Malbourge Flatlands<1ce0>!
Yes... Before such an important battle,<03e0>ample preparation is necessary. Return when<03e0>you are ready so that we may march.
No<07f0>you have no need to apologize. I knew<03e0>the folly of such an unreasonable request<03e0>from the start.<04e0>That said, if time bids you change your mind,<03e0>let me know.
Master Sykes. Through crises that threatened<03e0>the realm, you lent your steel not once, but<03e0>thrice...<04e0>I'll not forget this debt in my lifetime.
It is. However, once Marsha's prayers sealed<03e0>the monsters, the fear in their eyes was clear.<04e0>Those men will not threaten this land again.
Ophelia. To strike down those who flee,<03e0>accepting their defeat<07f0>does that not tarnish<03e0>the honor of the Order more than aught else?
Ophelia. Your pride in the Order rivals only my<03e0>own, and your strong sense of justice is one of<03e0>the reasons I wanted you in this position.
None can question your might with steel.<04e0>All that is left is your heart... A true knight<03e0>thinks of others before himself, and showing<03e0>mercy is not an effort, but second nature.
Master Sykes, forgive me; this parley has<03e0>stretched long. Yet I wish to repay my debt to<03e0>you to the extent of my ability.
If in your future travels, the road ahead<03e0>becomes rough, please call upon me.<04e0>No matter the trouble, I shall provide my<03e0>counsel and my steel without hesitation.
Oh, yes!<04e0>Master Sykes, take this as a token of our gratitude.
Master Sykes...
Commander! Is it true that the men behind all<03e0>this were allowed to escape with their lives!?
Commander, you are too soft!<04e0>Think of the losses the Order has suffered due<03e0>to those outlaws!<04e0>Crime cannot go unpunished. For the honor of<03e0>the Order, the cowards must be found and their<03e0>evils redressed.
Crime cannot go unpunished. For the honor of<03e0>the Order, the cowards must be found and their<03e0>evils redressed.
Commander...
See? Even Rush agrees.<04e0>I will not allow the men who assaulted my men<03e0>and my country to escape. They will pay for<03e0>their crimes against the Order!
I cannot forgive any group<03e0>that dares deceive Melphina!
(Urg, I gotta do the tie-break again?)<03e0>Well, a knight without mercy...<06e0000008e0000000000000>...isn't much of a knight.<09e008e0010000000000>...still gets the job done.
So, you will go with Roberto, will you?<03e0>You truly are a valiant youth.<04e0>You remind me of myself as a child.
Young Sykes.<03e0>There is an old tale passed down from ruler to<03e0>successor of this country for ages.<04e0>In the time before there was a land called<03e0>Melphina, there lived a beautiful priestess who<03e0>held a mysterious power.<04e0>Stunned by her beauty, the God Emperor<03e0>desired her for his own. But the priestess had<03e0>already promised her heart to a certain knight.<04e0>Bitterly angry, the emperor placed a curse<03e0>upon Crookfen.
From that moment, many demons appeared in<03e0>Crookfen. The area became known as a<03e0>forbidden place.<04e0>For three full days and nights the priestess<03e0>prayed, trying to return Crookfen to the<03e0>beautiful place it had been.
To protect the priestess as she prayed, the<03e0>knight sworn to her stood guard, slaying any<03e0>monster who dared assault her.<04e0>When the pair found themselves at the limit of<03e0>their strength, a dazzling light appeared,<03e0>enveloping the demons.<04e0>A Remnant with the power to seal evil had<03e0>awakened.<04e0>The earnest prayers of the strongly bound pair<03e0>had been enough to transcend time and space<03e0>and reach the Remnant...
What happened today, I believe,<03e0>brought me a taste of that legend.<04e0>Young Sykes, you are our country's hero.
Roberto. Let us not get ahead of ourselves.<03e0>For now, let us show our gratitude for young<03e0>Sykes's assistance in defending Melphina.
Young Sykes. You truly have become a hero to<03e0>our land.
Thank you, Meister Olebeag.<04e0>If the Remnant loses control, someone must seal it!
Everyone has returned...<03e0>We truly are blessed...
As Mistress Marsha says, someone must be breaking<03e0>the seal.<04e0>I wonder, are the culprits related to the men who<03e0>kidnapped us?
Your sense of honor is immeasurable...<03e0>I...I am deeply moved!
For the seal to just up and break like that?<03e0>That's never happened before...
Hey, Rush, you're coming with us, too?<03e0>That's so awesome!
They're marching on Melphina as we speak.<03e0>If we don't strike soon...
You've already done so much for us...<03e0>We won't forget it.
Neo, Mistress Marsha, everyone of the Order...<03e0>Please, be well!
You've brought my Neo home safely once again.<03e0>Thank you so, so much!

Our men on the front lines reported seeing men<03e0>garbed in black.<04e0>I can think of no other explanation but that the<03e0>men who abducted my knights were the ones<03e0>who destroyed the seal in Crookfen.
Everyone, I shall restore the seal now. Until it<03e0>is complete, monsters will continue to spawn...<03e0>I leave them to you. Fight well, knights.
Mistress Marsha...we depend on you.
This is where it ends...where we, the Order of<03e0>Melphina, stake our reputation and our lives to<03e0>defend our sworn homeland, no matter the cost.<04e0>For Melphina!
For Melphina!!!
Wh<07f0>whaaa!? The monsters...<03e0>Hypnos is disappearing! Bro, what'll we do!?
This power...<03e0>So this is the true strength of the bond<03e0>between the Order and the Forest Maidens?
Wroahhh!
We're out of options, and Melphina still won't<03e0>submit...<04e0>They're made of sterner stuff than we thought.<03e0>They...they've got something we just don't.
But, Bro... If we go home with a report like<03e0>that to the big man, we're gonna<07f001e00be00ae0>
Right...we won't be living to say much else.<03e0>He hates failure more than anything...
Yeah...<03e0>Hey<07f0>forget this. How 'bout we just get outta here?<04e0>Maybe if we run back home, the association's<03e0>assassins won't catch up!
...
It seems I was able to restore the seal.
Sir Roberto, knights of the Order, Master Sykes...<04e0>Your devotion and dedication to our beloved<03e0>country is what allowed my prayers to be<03e0>received by the heavens.
It is all thanks to you we still stand,<03e0>Mistress Marsha.
I must say the same for you, Sir Roberto...
(...Do these two need a room?)<03e006e0000008e0000000000000>(Maybe they'll be quick.)<09e008e0010000000000>*COUGH COUGH* AHEM!
Ah<07f0>ahh.<03e0>Come, all, let us return to Melphina.

Hey<07f0>hey kid. Got a minute?<06e0000008e0000000000000>What's up?<09e008e0010000000000>Not if you need a favor.
Okay, the job's real simple. I just need you to<03e0>find a girl and bring her here to town.<04e0>See, everyone in town's getting ready for a big<03e0>celebration called the Kosmosfest.<04e0>It's an ancient festival that's been held for<03e0>hundreds of years. However, for some reason<03e0>this year's Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it yet.<04e0>Folks in town have started wondering if she's<03e0>okay, but we're so busy getting things ready<03e0>that we don't have time to go look for her.<04e0>So, I'd like you to go out and find the Cosmos<03e0>Maiden for us.<04e0>I mean, she probably just left late, or is<03e0>traveling kinda leisurely, something like that,<03e0>but you never know if she ran into monsters...<04e0>Anyhow, we're sort of in a hurry, right? So, will<03e0>you help us out?<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'll get your maiden back safe!<09e008e0010000000300>Sorry, not interested...
It's not even that troublesome of a favor...<03e0>Well, if you change your mind, let me know.
Great! I really appreciate it.<04e0>I'm sure she just got caught up somewhere<03e0>along the way... Probably <1be0ffbe34ff>Crookfen<1ce0>. Try looking<03e0>around there, would you?
Oh...<03e0>Guess you've got stuff to do as well, right?<04e0>Well, I guess we'll figure something out. Sorry<03e0>for springing this on you out of the blue.
Most likely the Cosmos Maiden's gotten lost in<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Crookfen<1ce0>, north of Melphina.<04e0>She could've gotten caught up in something,<03e0>maybe something bad... Please, find her and<03e0>make sure she's alright, okay?
What, you changed your mind<07f0>you can go find<03e0>the Cosmos Maiden for us?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure. See you in a bit.<09e008e0010000000300>I was just saying hi...
Great! I really appreciate it.<04e0>I'm sure she just got caught up somewhere<03e0>along the way... Probably <1be0ffbe34ff>Crookfen<1ce0>. Try looking<03e0>around there, would you?
Oh... Sorry, you had me getting my hopes up.<03e0>Well, with all the stuff I've gotta do, guess I<03e0>can't complain about others being busy.
Heyyy, it's you! Finally, I've been waiting for you to<03e0>come back!<04e0>The Cosmos Maiden just showed up a minute ago,<03e0>safe and sound. She made it in time for the festival.<03e0>What a load off my chest!<04e0>Though I figured you'd come in together...<03e0>You get split up or something?<04e0>Ah, whatever, whatever, no biggie. The point is,<03e0>you totally saved me and the festival<07f0>thanks.<03e0>Take this.
Alright... Guess I'd better get back to work.<03e0>There's still so much to do for the festival...<03e0>We'll be burning the midnight oil on this one.<04e0>I've gotta run, but thanks again! And make<03e0>sure you come back for the Kosmosfest,<03e0>alright?
Traditionally, they pick a girl from Melphina to<03e0>be the maiden of the Kosmosfest.<04e0>They always choose really cute girls, so I'm<03e0>totally looking forward to seeing this year's...<03e0>Man, what's taking her so long?
Kosmosfest is a celebration for the people.<03e0>The Cosmos Maiden wishes for world peace<03e0>by binding the Remnant Syltique.<04e0>If she can successfully bind the Remnant, the<03e0>following year will be peaceful... At least,<03e0>that's how the story goes.<04e0>Lately, the world's been in a crazy state, so I<03e0>can only hope this year's binding works out.
After the festival, all kinds of crazies start<03e0>imitating the Cosmos Maiden, praying all willy-<03e0>nilly and whatnot. What a bunch of maroons!<04e0>...That said, if the people here weren't such<03e0>simpletons, we wouldn't get a festival at a<03e0>time like this, I suppose.
This year, the Cosmos Maiden's s'posed ta be<03e0>coming down from Melphina all by her<03e0>lonesome.<04e0>They say it's a test of her trainin'<07f0>ta see if<03e0>she's properly learnt her mystic arts or not.
Ahh, when it comes down to it, the whole<03e0>festival's just like a good luck charm, you<03e0>know?<04e0>Back in the day, it was actually a symbol of<03e0>peace... Things sure have changed.

Hm? You're still here.<03e0>Did you need something?<03e007f0>Ohhh, are you lost?<04e0>*giggle* You look all straight-laced, but really,<03e0>you're just a silly-head mimbo!

But to be done already is like getting<03e0>an early birthday present!<04e0>Oh yeah!

Well, here in Nagapur I've got something really<03e0>really important I have to do, so I'll see you<03e0>later, okay? Bye-bye!
Phew...<03e0>Nagapur's only a little bit farther, I bet!<04e0>Still, it seems like getting here took forever!<03e0>Wonder if there'll be time for a nap...I'm pooped!<04e0>But at least we're here. Forget a nap, pretty much<03e0>the whole time we were coming here, I was getting<03e0>ready for the big sleep! Everything was so scary...<04e0>Now that I think of it, you did protect me, more<03e0>or less. So thank you!
Well, here in Nagapur I've got something really<03e0>really important I have to do, so I'll see you<03e0>later, okay? Toodleoo!

Kosmosfest is about to commence!<03e0>The maiden is safe and ready for the festivities!<04e0>Although that doesn't mean this is going to be<03e0>a wild party. We're going to pray quietly along<03e0>the Calm Shores for world peace.
Speaking of which, I have a task for you.<04e0>To make this festival a success and to ensure<03e0>the maiden's safety, I'd like for someone<03e0>to rid the Calm Shores of monsters.<04e0>Not just one or two<07f0>I want you to<03e0>defeat them all.<03e0>Will you do it for the festival's sake?<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm on it!<09e008e0010000000300>I'm not up for that right now.
I knew I could count on you!<03e0>I want you to head to <1be0ffbe34ff>Fornstrand<1ce0> immediately.<04e0>The festival's success lies in your hands.
Think of the trouble you went through to rescue<03e0>the maiden!<03e0>Please?
The Calm Shores need to be safe for<03e0>the festival to be a success.<03e0>I really need you to defeat those monsters.<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm on it!<09e008e0010000000300>I'm still not up for it.

I guess the task was hard for even you<03e0>to handle.<03e0>Are you willing to give it another go?<06e0000008e0000000000000>You know it!<09e008e0010000000300>Not really.
Great! We're counting on you.
Everyone will be so disappointed if<03e0>there's no festival this year.
Thank you so much!<04e0>This festival is important because through it,<03e0>we're trying to convey that war is meaningless<03e0>and unnecessary.
I know everyone will realize that.<03e0>And when they do, the world will be<03e0>a peaceful place.
Or no one will realize that and the world<03e0>will fall to pieces.
I won't let that happen! I can't!
I'm just kidding, Sheryl.
Here, take this.
If you ever need assistance, Rush, don't be shy to<03e0>ask for my help. You can find me in the guild.<04e0>My goal now is to tell the entire world about those poor<03e0>fishies! If there's a war, those fishies will die!
They're so adorable, but I'm exhausted from counting<03e0>them all! There must have been a hundred of them!

Rush! You came!<04e0>I'm kinda nervous, but I can do this!
Once you defeat all these monsters,<03e0>I'm going to start the festival!
Isn't this beautiful?<04e0>Countless lights gather together<03e0>to become one Remnant.<04e0>The Remnant itself doesn't do anything.<03e0>It can't fight monsters or bad guys.<04e0>But this Remnant that is left here has<03e0>a beauty that awes and inspires people.<03e0>This Remnant Syltique...
It is the most important Remnant<03e0>in all of the world.<04e0>If it weren't for this magnificent piece<03e0>of art, the world would be a place of war<03e0>and nothing but war.
The Syltique tells us...<03e0>Tells us that there's so much more.<04e0>The world has its horrors, but it<03e0>also has good and beauty.

Sir! I know this may sound forward, but I need help...<03e0>Would you listen to my story, at least? <04e0>My homeland was destroyed by a terrible man. I've sworn<03e0>to get revenge on him and return my home to its former<03e0>glory. But I do not have the strength to do it alone...
I've heard that a strong fighter lives in <1be0ffbe34ff>Dillmoor<1ce0>... One<03e0>skilled not only in combat, but in leadership as well.<04e0>I want to meet him, and learn his techniques. I am sure<03e0>that with that knowledge, I could return honor to my<03e0>homeland! Would you be kind enough to lead me there?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, if you want.<09e008e0010000000300>I'm no tour guide.
Thank you!<03e007f0>Oh, I almost forgot. My name is Glenys.<03e0>Anyway, let's get going to <1be0ffbe34ff>Dillmoor<1ce0>!
Oh, I see... You must be busy.<03e0>W-well, if your schedule frees up any, then<03e0>please let me know. I'll...probably be here...
Oh<07f0>it's you again.<03e0>For the honor of my people,<03e0>I must get revenge on that man!
But to do that, I need to learn the techniques<03e0>of a master. Please, if you take me to him,<03e0>I promise to make it worth your while.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Alright already, geez.<09e008e0010000000300>Dude. No means no.
Thank you, so much! I'd hoped you'd come<03e0>around<07f0>you did come back and all. And they<03e0>say that youth today are all good-for-nothings!<04e007f0>Oh yes, I'm Glenys, nice to meet you.<03e0>Anyhow, let's get going to <1be0ffbe34ff>Dillmoor<1ce0>!
Oh...I see.<03e0>Well, uh, if you change your mind, I'll be here!<03e0>Ahahah...ha. *sigh*
So the master's famous technique was a battle<03e0>formation he had created himself. I admit, I expected<03e0>something different...<04e0>Well, maybe someone with your knowledge of tactics<03e0>can make the best use of this technique.<04e0>Perhaps you can help me avenge my people, and I<03e0>can help you accomplish your goals as well.
I know I still have a lot to work on, but...<03e0>Please, let me join your group!<04e0>I'll be waiting at the guild, whenever you need me.
We shall head to <1be0ffbe34ff>Dillmoor<1ce0>.
We shall head to <1be0ffbe34ff>Aveclyff<1ce0>.

I'm pretty sure that the fighting master we're looking<03e0>for is down here.<04e0>Let's keep our wits about us from here, okay?
Oh yes. So, the master I'm looking for is said to have<03e0>turned into a monster after a lifetime of battle. Funny<03e0>how things turn out, isn't it?<04e0>Anyhow, I'm sure he's still here<07f0>honestly, there<03e0>aren't that many other places he could go. Most likely<03e0>one of these beasts is him.<04e0>Come along, Rush!<04e0>Keep your eyes open for anything strange, alright?
So, this is his final technique...?<03e0>Ah... I see...

Just look at the depravity of the imperial city today...<03e0>Sickening, isn't it? Though it goes to show that what<03e0>goes around comes around...
It's a fairly common rumor that treasures from many of<03e0>the old kingdoms have begun circulating through the<03e0>black market here.<04e0>If something from my homeland has ended up there,<03e0>I must have it, no matter the cost. Will you help me<03e0>look?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Let's go treasure hunting!<09e008e0010000000300>Your stuff is long gone.

I am certain someone with ties to this black market is<03e0>here in the imperial city. It's just a matter of finding the<03e0>right man.
You may be right...<03e0>But I can't give up! Not after I've come so far.
Finally... The Spear of Origin has returned to its<03e0>rightful people. Rush...I can't even begin to thank you.<04e0>My long journey has finally come to an end...<03e0>I finally feel right in saying that.
From now on, Rush, my life is yours.<03e0>I'll fight for you with all I've got!
Countries have offered up tribute to the God Emperor<03e0>for centuries. Treasures sent from the land's greatest<03e0>artisans were a source of pride.<04e0>But now, the imperial city has fallen so low, even these<03e0>offerings have ended up on the black market.<04e0>My country's tribute must be here as well... I must<03e0>obtain it, no matter what. You'll help me, won't you,<03e0>Rush?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Let's hit the antiques roadshow!<09e008e0010000000300>You're not gonna find it.

Someone here in <1be0ffbe34ff>Undelwalt<1ce0> will know about the black<03e0>market here. We should find them and ask them about<03e0>the treasures.
That might be true...<03e0>But I can't give up! Not after I've come so far.
You again? Can't get enough, eh?<04e0>The Phantom City was respected by even the Imperator.<03e0>This is their greatest treasure: the blade <1be064f4ecff>Finsternis<1ce0>.<03e0>The name means "darkness."<04e0>Trust me, I don't offer this to just anyone.

You there<07f0>who are you? Do you know me?<03e0>Do I know you?<04e0>I know my name is Jorgen...but I don't know<03e0>anything else.<04e0>What sort of man was I? Where did I live? What<03e0>was my job? What activities did I enjoy? I have<03e0>no memory of any of it.<04e0>Hmm? Your talisman, it<07f004e0>Ah, sorry. I thought you'd reminded me of<03e0>something, but I guess not.<04e0>Wait...<03e0>This could be a good method. Ingenious, even.<04e0>I'm fairly certain that asking you a favor at our<03e0>first meeting seems somewhat rude, but I want<03e0>to do whatever I can to regain my memory.<04e0>Here is what I ask: could you find things that<03e0>seem as if they could have some connection to<03e0>me, and bring them here?<04e0>I feel as if viewing them may trigger a memory.<03e0>Even if I could have only one, I would be<03e0>forever grateful.<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'll see what I can do.<09e008e0010000000300>Be happy...memories suck.
I appreciate it, truly. I am in your debt.<04e0>I'll trust your intuition. If you can find three things<03e0>that really call to you about me, then please<03e0>bring them to me. I'm sure it will help.
Perhaps...perhaps so. It's true that some have<03e0>pasts they wish to forget so badly that my<03e0>situation seems a boon.<04e0>Forgive me for asking. I'll try to regain my<03e0>memories by myself.
Hmm? Oh! You, I remember! Have you come to<03e0>help me remember more?<04e0>I'm just looking for things that could remind<03e0>me of myself. If you could bring such a thing<03e0>here, I'd be much obliged.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Okay, I'll give it a go.<09e008e0010000000300>You can live without 'em!
I appreciate it, truly. I am in your debt.<04e0>I'll trust your intuition. If you can find three things<03e0>that really call to you about me, then please<03e0>bring them to me. I'm sure it will help.
Certainly, that is true, I believe... Yet I do not<03e0>wish to do so. I'll do what I can to restore my<03e0>memory on my own.
Oh, it's the one I remember again! You look like<03e0>you have something for me<07f0>three somethings, even!<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah, here you go!<09e008e0010000000300>Nope, still looking!

Such dedication... I'll continue to do what I can<03e0>on my end to regain my memory.
I'm beginning to remember...
I remember this...yes, yes!<03e0>Yes... That happened, back then...
Yes... I remember! I...
Thanks to your help, I've been able to remember<03e0>how I've lived...how I've come to where I am today.<04e0>But the past is not everything... From now on, I<03e0>must find how to live in my present.<04e0>That said,<03e0>I believe it's well past time to get started. <03e0>Thank you, Rush. Someday, may we meet again.
This blade...it's as if it were made for my hand.<03e0>What a feeling...surely no other sword would do.<03e0>I must have been a great warrior with this weapon!
Holding this staff... What a strange, warm feeling<03e0>I get. Yes...I was skilled at mystic arts, wasn't I...
This bandanna... I feel like just tying it on would<03e0>give me the feeling I could take on the world. Yes...<03e0>This must have given me courage.
Hm? This is my handwriting... This must be my<03e0>journal! The pages are filled with formulas, and<03e0>worn with use. To think I was so studious...
Oh! This letter helped me through so many hard times...<03e0>It's from<07f0>yes, from the person I admire most in the<03e0>world. I felt that if I read it, maybe I could be like him...
This belt... It looks so old<07f0>no, no, call it<03e0>"experienced"... Yes, yes, putting it on made me<03e0>feel as if I overflowed with strength.
Why...these boots are the same as the ones I'm<03e0>wearing now. Just worn completely through... I must<03e0>have made some incredible journeys in them!
Yes... I traveled many battlefields with this shield on<03e0>my arm. Got me out of many a scrape! Every notch<03e0>and dent brings back more memories of my battles...
I was a swordsman...well known for my skill with<03e0>a blade. Once I obtained a certain sword as<03e0>part of my spoils...unfortunately, it held a curse.<04e0>To keep it from absorbing my soul, I had to<03e0>pay a great price...that of my past.
My father was a famed sage. I'd admired him<03e0>since I was a boy, and studied for years to<03e0>match even a fraction of his skill.<04e0>But then came the accident... My father was<03e0>killed. It was too much for me to bear, and I<03e0>lost control of my faculties...my memories, as well.
I was the leader of a group of rogues... Hah, that<03e0>makes it sound so romantic, when we were just<03e0>a group of thugs. Backstabbing thugs...<04e0>The group betrayed me...life was hell from then<03e0>on out. I was so focused on getting revenge,<03e0>I'd pay any cost...including my memories.
I was a powerful general in my home country.<03e0>The fierce assaults I plotted led us to<03e0>countless victories...<04e0>However, the constant focus on war began to<03e0>eat away at me. To restore my equilibrium, I<03e0>erased everything about myself...even my memories.
I'm scion of the royal family. <07f0>Not of here, but<03e0>of a land far away... After my father's death,<03e0>the kingdom fell into disarray.<04e0>After a drawn-out battle, my younger brother<03e0>claimed the throne, using a magus's spell to<03e0>wipe my memory and banish me here.
I...I'm not fully mortal. I'm sure a full explanation<03e0>would be wasted on you, so let's just say it's<03e0>not mitra blood that flows through my veins.<04e0>However, I am still an imperfect being...<03e0>Only in exchange for the temporary loss of my<03e0>memories was I allowed to stay in this world.
I was an adventurer, traveling the world to find<03e0>my fortune. Once, when treasure hunting in a<03e0>deep cavern, I came across a mysterious insect.<04e0>I fought it, thinking it was just another bug. Boy,<03e0>was I wrong... It was a parasite, feeding off of<03e0>memories. So it ate mine...and you know the rest.
Surely you've searched enough?
If you can determine what is truly mine, then<03e0>come back and tell me.
These three things...I can have them?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup!<09e008e0010000000300>Mmm...no.
I guess you can't tell what's mine...
Did you find anything that could jog my memory<03e0>yet? Or maybe three things, that would be good, yes.<04e0>I'm sure just a little jog would help. I'm counting on you!
Oh, you have things<07f0>things for me? How kind!<03e0>But...I don't think you have enough. If you could find<03e0>three... Three is a good number, yes.<04e0>But, thanks to you, I feel as if my memories could<03e0>return at any moment. The rest I leave to you...
So, that's who I am...<03e0>Oh, I really should give you something...<03e0>Ah, yes, take this.

Loki?<03e0>Where are you?<04e0>How annoying! He disappeared while I was still talking<03e0>and I hadn't finished my story!
...<03e0>Uh... Um...<04e0>Oops, sorry!<03e0>Did you want something?<04e0>I'm Reya.<03e0>Who're you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm Rush.<09e008e0010000000000>...
Rush, huh?<03e0>Got it.<03e0>What a cool name!
Huh?<03e0>I was certain someone was there...
What?<03e0>You're asking if I know Loki?<04e0>I sure do!<03e0>He's my friend.<04e0>Are you his friend, too?<03e0>Be nice to him, okay?<03e0>He's really, really shy.
Be real nice to him.<03e0>He's really, really shy.
I know you're there!<03e0>Come on out!<04e0>I'm Reya.<03e0>Who're you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm Rush.<09e008e0010000000000>...
Rush, huh?<03e0>Got it.<03e0>What a cool name!
Huh?<03e0>I thought I sensed someone, but I guess not.
Huh? Ummm...<03e0>I'm sorry, but who're you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm Rush.<09e008e0010000000000>No one important.
That's right<07f0>Rush!<03e0>I'm sorry.<03e0>I'm terrible at remembering names...<04e0>Okay, I really got it this time.<03e0>Really!
I'm sorry if that sounded rude.<03e0>I'm just bad with names.<03e0>Your voice sounded really familiar, though.
Loki keeps disappearing on me.<03e0>I was just talking to him a second ago.<04e0>He seems to go away when you come along.<04e0>I wonder why. Maybe he's scared of you. But you<03e0>seem like a really nice person.
Uh... Um...<03e0>You're Rush, right?<03e0>I knew it!<04e0>You know, I bet you're<03e0>a real good-looking guy.<04e0>You have to be because you smell<03e0>real nice, like the smell of<03e0>freshly done laundry!

Rush.<03e0>I dunno if I should throw this on you, but I can't think<03e0>of anything else to do.<04e0>I might've told you already, but I'm lookin' for an elixir<03e0>to fix Reya's eyesight.<04e0>I haven't gotten lucky yet, but I managed to get hold<03e0>of some information from some merchants passin'<03e0>through.<04e0>In a place not too far away grows a flower called<03e0>"Visuminsumo." Apparently, it's got the power to give<03e0>people their sight back.<04e0>You can find the flowers at the top of <1be0ffbe34ff>Mt. Vackel<1ce0>.<03e0>At least, that's what I heard.<04e0>I woulda gone once I heard the stuff existed, but I<03e0>gotta be careful...if somethin' were to happen to me,<03e0>Reya'd be devastated.<04e0>Plus, travelin' with you, I can't just go off on my own.<04e0>So, wouldja come to <1be0ffbe34ff>Mt.

Knew I could count on you.<04e0>I have a vague idea of what the flowers look like, so<03e0>once we get there, leave it to me.
I want her to see, period.<03e0>If you can find the time to help me out, lemme know.
Visuminsumos grow on Mt. Vackel. I got a vague idea<03e0>of what they look like, so once we get there, leave it<03e0>to me.<04e0>I'll do anything to help Reya regain her sight. You gotta<03e0>help me.
Did you change your mind?<03e0>Are you going to help me or not?<04e0>I need to go to <1be0ffbe34ff>Mt. Vackel<1ce0> to get Reya some<03e01be064f4ecff>visuminsumos<1ce0>. I want you to come with me.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah, I'm ready to go.<09e008e0010000000300>I'm still not sure...
Knew I could count on ya.<04e0>I have a vague idea of what the flowers look like, so<03e0>once we get there, leave it to me.
Why don't you let me do the thinking here, eh? You just<03e0>do what you gotta and come back, alright?
You gonna help me or what? I need ya to come with<03e0>me to <1be0ffbe34ff>Mt. Vackel<1ce0> to get <1be064f4ecff>visuminsumos<1ce0>.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, I'll go.<09e008e0010000000300>Sorry, I need some more time.
I want to do everything I can for Reya.<03e0>Help me get her sight back.
Alright, alright, I get it.<03e0>Well, if you ever get ready, lemme know.

They should be growin' around here...
This is it.<03e0>It matches the merchants' description.<03e0>It's gotta be this.
Rush, thanks for lending a hand.<03e0>Let's get outta here before...
Damn...<03e0>I was afraid of this.<04e0>The merchants mentioned this monster... Mainly that it<03e0>almost killed 'em.<04e0>It'll go away if we leave the flowers, but I can't do that.<03e0>Come on, Rush!
What a waste of time.
Rush, I need another favor.<04e0>I don't want Reya to know what I look like. I'm hideous.<03e0>Can you take these to her instead?<04e0>And give her this message.
Tell her...I died.

Hi! You're Rush...right?<03e0>How are you today?<04e0>Huh? You have flowers for me?<03e0>From Loki?<04e0>I don't know why he's being so shy,<03e0>since we're such good friends!<04e0>These flowers smell wonderful!<03e0>Do you know what they're called?<04e0>...<04e0>What? Really!?<03e0>These flowers can make me see again?<04e0>...<04e0>Alright.<03e0>I don't care how it happens,<03e0>I just want to be able to see!

I can really see!<03e0>So this is what the world looks like...<03e0>It's amazing!<04e0>Do you know where Loki is?<03e0>I have to thank him right away!<04e0>...<04e0>What's wrong?

Say something! Please?<03e0>...Fine!<03e0>I'll go look for him myself!
Loki, it's you, isn't it?<03e0>Thank you so much!

Loki!
Reya.<03e0>I didn't want you to see me.<03e0>I know I'm hideous.
No, not at all!<03e0>You're exactly like I'd imagined you'd be! Better, even...<04e0>I never told you this, but I know all about you, Loki.<03e0>I've known all along. Even what you did to Father.
*gasp*
To be honest, I despised you at first.<03e0>But now, all I want is you beside me.<04e0>I know now.<03e0>I know that you're the only one for me.
Thank you, Reya... Thank you.

But woe! As if Fate itself envies my beauty (as well<03e0>it should), that flower only grows in the <1be0ffbe34ff>Catacombs<1ce0>!<04e0>Such a putrid atmosphere! And filled with beasts<03e0>disgusting enough that the mere mention of their<03e0>presence bids me wash out my mouth!<04e0>It's impossible...<03e0>Never could one pure as I enter such a place!<06e0000008e0000000000000>Calm down. I'll do it.<09e008e0010000000300>Dude, suck it up.
Marvelous!<03e0>Thus I may continue to be untainted.
Away, uncouth fiend!<03e0>Ohh, to be clean once more!
Ugh... The mere thought of entering the <1be0ffbe34ff>Catacombs<1ce003e0>and encountering the filthy beasts within makes my<03e0>gorge rise... I fear I may swoon...<06e0000008e0000000000000>Calm down, I'll do it!<09e008e0010000000300>Just don't swoon on me.
Magnificent!<03e0>Unlike myself, you are flawed, and thus lose<03e0>nothing by contacting such horrid beasts.<04e0>Yet were I in your position they would not be able to<03e0>keep their hands off me<07f0>not that I could blame<03e0>them.
Leave me, traitor to all things pure and clean!<03e0>Woe! Woe am I!
Hark! What is that enrapturous aroma?<03e0>A sweet scent worthy of my pure white pelt!<04e0>I must be honest. Under normal circumstances,<03e0>I would reward an unsightly youth such as yourself<03e0>by extinguishing your pitiful existence.<04e0>Unfortunately, I have places to be.<04e0>A glittering future awaits my presence with bated<03e0>breath!
Thus, I bid you adieu. Until we meet again!<03e0>Though I hope that next time you wash your hands,<03e0>at least.
Then away to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Catacombs<1ce0>! Bring me the <1be064f4ecff>seeds of<03e0>the white flower<1ce0>, that its nectar might purify me to my<03e0>natural brilliance once more!!!
You may have difficulty, as the aroma of the <1be064f4ecff>white flower<1ce003e0>is often masked by the stench of <1be0ffbe34ff>albic qsiti<1ce0>.<04e0>If you destroy the beasts, it should be a simple matter to<03e0>find the seeds. Slay those accursed albic qsitis, then pay<03e0>attention to the scent of the flower.<04e0>I trust that even you should be able to handle that.

Young man...<03e0>Yes, you.<03e0>Come closer; I've a task to ask of you.
Do you know the <1be0ffbe34ff>Catacombs<1ce0> in the nation of Elysion?<03e0>It's said they hold a treasure hundreds of years old.<04e0>The treasure is an ancient book, outlining the<03e0>forbidden process of how to bring back the dead.<04e0>Legend has it that the Forest Maidens were so<03e0>worried of the book's misuse that they sealed it<03e0>away, deep within the Catacombs.
You see what I'm getting at? I'd appreciate your<03e0>discretion... To certain persons, this may seem<03e0>distressingly like grave robbery, I fear.<04e0>Both your participation and mine in this endeavor<03e0>would need to be kept secret.
I realize it seems lower than low not to do the deed<03e0>myself, but... Were I to enter the Catacombs, I would<03e0>have to face...them.
And I...I cannot. How could I face them, after<07f003e0>And they wail so loud, already, it's as if my head<03e0>would burst... It is too much for me to bear.<04e0>...That's why I need you to retrieve the Forbidden Tome.
Certainly, you'll be amply rewarded. What do you say?<03e006e0000008e0000000000000>Alright...I'll get the book.<09e008e0010000000300>Sorry, I'm no tomb raider.
Ohh! I'd hoped from the look of you that you'd<03e0>understand my need. You surpass even my<03e0>expectations.
The Forbidden Tome is hidden deep within the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Catacombs<1ce0>.<04e0>It's said that many fierce and fearsome beasts have<03e0>taken the area for their lairs... Be certain to stay on<03e0>your guard.
...Perhaps you do not realize it, but my time is<03e0>short<07f0>and worth more than you can imagine.<04e0>Accept this task before I change my mind on<03e0>offering it to you. Believe me, that is something<03e0>you would soon regret.
I've been waiting...too long. What's taken you so<03e0>long? Did you get the Forbidden Tome?
What!?<03e0>The Forbidden Tome no longer exists!?
Do not test my patience, boy! Without that book, it's all<03e0>wrong, all wrong... How am I to bring them back...!
That...that picture!
(What should I say?)<03e006e0000008e0000000000000>It's a squad of the Melphina Army.<09e008e0010000000000>Your men were worried...
N-NOOOOOO!!!<03e0>Stop...please, stop!
T-take this...take it and go!<03e0>I don't want to see that picture again, please...!<04e0>My head...the pain...
That's absurd. Why do you say such things?
You...you're back, yet empty-handed. Could you not<03e0>find the Tome? It should be in the <1be0ffbe34ff>western section<1ce0>.<06e0000008e0000000000000>West, huh? I'm on it!<09e008e0010000000300>I dunno about this...
Excellent. Then hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Catacombs<1ce0>!
Do not toy with me, boy. Believe me that it would be<03e0>in your best interests to finish this task while I am still<03e0>in good humor.

Due to that monster, our souls have been<03e0>trapped here for years.
But thanks to you destroying the beast, we can<03e0>finally pass on to Elysion.
Wh-what? You're here looking for the Forbidden Tome!?<04e0>...Don't tell me. You were sent here by a white qsiti<03e0>with piercing red eyes, right?
This may all seem a little strange, but...<04e0>Once, he was the squad leader of the army division<03e0>we were attached to. He was a warm and kind person,<03e0>up until that battle...<04e0>In a battle ten years ago, on the Holy Plain, our<03e0>division was completely destroyed. Only the captain<03e0>made it out alive.
We were on the front lines...it couldn't be helped.<03e0>But the captain was devastated, and took all blame<03e0>for our deaths onto himself.
We're afraid that while we've been trapped down here,<03e0>the captain's soul has been eaten away.<04e0>He has nightmares every night, and is tormented by<03e0>phantom voices... It's destroyed his spiritual balance.
I'm sure he figures that if he can get the Forbidden<03e0>Tome, he can use it to bring us back to life...that's why<03e0>he hired you.<04e0>But that book no longer exists<07f0>not as anything but a<03e0>memory, anyway. It's been hundreds of years. The book<03e0>is nothing but dust.<04e0>To think that the captain still is searching for it, after<03e0>so many years...
It's painful to see him like this, but there isn't<03e0>much we can do. We're no longer of this world...<03e0>Soon, we'll pass on to Elysion.
Please, could you give this to the captain? And<03e0>tell him<07f0>tell him we have no regrets, so he<03e0>doesn't need to have them, either.
Captain... Please, don't lose yourself.<03e0>Let us go...
(A white, red-eyed qsiti, huh?)<03e006e0000008e0000000000000>Yup, that's him.<09e008e0010000000000>Uhh...I don't remember.

Hello there, traveler... From the way you move,<03e0>I can see you know how to...handle a sword.<03e0>Mmm...just the type I've been looking for...
My name is Hannah. I work as a hired blade,<03e0>along with my sister, Hinnah.<04e0>We were clearing out monsters from the ruins<03e0>to the southwest...<1be0ffbe34ff>Mojcado Castle<1ce0>, I believe<03e0>it's called. However, just as we finished...
Hinnah refused to return. It seems she'd lost<03e0>something important in the ruins, and remained<03e0>to look for it.<04e0>Certainly, I helped her search as well, but...
We...argued, and I left the ruins alone.<04e0>But honestly, for a frail little thing like me to<03e0>be stuck in such a dank, dirty place full of<03e0>monsters? I couldn't stand another minute.<04e0>A girl can only take so much... I'm sure a man<03e0>like you would understand.
Still... I can't help but worry about Hinnah,<03e0>especially all alone in those ruins...<04e0>She's my only sister in all the world.<03e0>If anything were to happen to her, I don't know<03e0>what I'd do...<04e0>Please, brave traveler, could you find her and<03e0>bring her back? I'd be so grateful. I'm sure I<03e0>could find some way to reward you...
You'll help me, won't you?<03e006e0000008e0000000000000>Y-yes! Very yes!<09e008e0010000000300>Uh, can I think about it?
Perfect!<03e0>Somehow, I knew you'd help!<04e0>Retrieve Hinnah from that awful place as soon<03e0>as you possibly can... Then come back to me<03e0>for your reward.
Oh, and a warning: Hinnah is a very stubborn<03e0>girl. I doubt she'll listen to anything you say<03e0>until she finds whatever she's lost.
"Think"... Meaning, no.<03e0>I see...<04e0>Come back if you ever change your mind.<03e0>I promise, I'd be very...very...grateful.
Hinnah is the most important person in the<03e0>world to me...my darling sister. Won't you find<03e0>her and bring her back to me?<04e0>I'd do anything to get her back...and I mean<03e0>anything.
Oh, it's my brave traveler...returning triumphant.<03e0>Hinnah arrived just a while ago. Thank you<03e0>for your help.<04e0>Still, she looked as though she'd been pulled<03e0>through a pig sty. You know, you ought to be<03e0>more careful when handling a lady.
Well, she's back safely, and that's what really<03e0>matters. I really do appreciate it.<04e0>Say... What was it that she dropped in the first<03e0>place? She wouldn't say a word about it.
Hmm? An old, tarnished earring?<04e0>So that's what it was... Hinnah and I saved up<03e0>and bought those earrings when we were<03e0>children. To think, she still treasures them so...
Anyway.<03e0>This is no time to travel down memory lane.<04e0>It's time for me...to give you...your reward.
This? This is a promise for the next time we<03e0>meet. Feel free to consider it an IOU.<04e0>Hopefully, then we'll have the luxury of creating<03e0>a firmer and...deeper connection. Look forward<03e0>to it...I certainly am.<04e0>Until we meet again!

You little bastard!<03e0>That monster was mine!
Goddammit! I finally find something that<03e0>maybe might be worth fighting down here and<03e0>you go and take it out!
You owe me a corpse, asshole! Mind if I<03e0>take yours!?
Ugh, whatever. Hannah sent you, didn't she,<03e0>trying to get me to go home and be a lady and<03e0>all that shit?
Both of you can kiss my ass. I dropped<03e0>something real important in these ruins, and<03e0>I'll be damned if I leave without it.
Huh?<03e0>What's that you're holding? Show it to me.
Holy hell<07f0>that's my earring! Where the hell'd<03e0>you find that? I've been looking for that thing<03e0>all over this hole!<04e0>Okay, that almost makes up for having bogarted<03e0>my trophy monster before. Guess I won't have<03e0>to break your legs after all.
But don't think you'll get off this easy twice.<03e0>Try that again and you're gonna regret it.<04e0>Now...back to Hannah. She's probably going<03e0>apeshit by now.
Aw, man... I'm covered in dirt and grime. I just<03e0>know Hannah's gonna throw a bitchfit again...
The girl is surrounded by monsters...

I'll take somethin'<03e0>from you instead<07f0>your life.

Hey, wanna hear a story?<04e0>Once upon a time, there lived a fierce monster who loved<03e0>fighting more than anything else in the whole world.<04e0>It fought so much, and for so long, that eventually,<03e0>it forgot how to do anything else.<04e0>The monster's heart became hard as polished steel. It<03e0>couldn't even really be called a "heart" anymore. And<03e0>eventually, even the monster's body had become a blade.
...Like it? I know it's just a story, but this weird old man<03e0>who came by earlier totally believed it! Crazy, huh?<04e0>Not only that, but he said he was gonna find the sword,<03e0>and ran off!<04e0>But there've been a bunch of bandits around... It's no<03e0>place for senile old geezers, you know? Can you go<03e0>check on him, make sure he's okay?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Should be...interesting.<09e008e0010000000300>He'll probably be okay.
Thanks, mister! That's real nice of you!<04e0>The cave with the sword is supposed to be in<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Lavafender<1ce0>. Be careful, okay?
Well, maybe...<03e0>I've just got a bad feeling about it...
I know it sounds unbelievable for a monster to turn into<03e0>a sword, but that weird old guy totally believed it!<04e0>There're bandits around there, and I think he's kinda...<03e0>You know. Think you could check in on him? I'd feel a<03e0>lot better to know he's alright.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Okay, okay.<09e008e0010000000300>Ehh, he's lived this long.
Thanks for changing your mind! I owe you one, for real.<04e0>Grandma says the cave with the sword is in <1be0ffbe34ff>Lavafender<1ce0>.<03e0>Be careful, okay?
I guess so...<03e0>I dunno, I just have a bad feeling about this...
So, the old man was okay?<03e0>Thank goodness!<04e0>Thanks, mister!<03e0>Here, for your trouble.
What a kooky old guy!<03e0>I hope I can meet him again.

Huh? No way, it's someone different.
Either way, let's kick his ass!
What the hell is wrong with that old fart?<03e0>I can't believe he just up and killed our buds!
He's after the sword, right? Hell, let's just let him try and<03e0>take it. Once he gets close enough, it'll take care of him,<03e0>heheh.
You've got a point...<03e007f0>Hey! Who's there?
Whoever you are, you're going down!
So...<03e0>This is the famed blade...
Hey! We've been after that blade for who knows how<03e0>long! Like we're gonna give it up that easy? Think again!
Graghhh!
Rrgh, dammit! Kill the old geezer!
Who the hell're you? Stay outta this!
Hahahahaha!<03e0>What tenacious will!<03e0>It overflows with the desire for blood!<04e0>Now...accept my bidding!
N-no way! Th-that thing was cursed<07f0>anyone who<03e0>got near it died!
Then I'll convince it to be mine!

You have come.<03e0>I have found out the agenda of the Third Committee.<03e0>But I must inform you of something.
They have taken the Remnant research they obtained<03e0>and used it to create a Remnant themselves<07f0>one<03e0>that is a weapon.<04e0>At the Academy, the project was referred to by the<03e0>code name "Leithion." The weapon created was a<03e0>blade<07f01be064f4ecff>Leithion's Sword<1ce0>.
This weapon can trigger a Collapse at will as a way of<03e0>gaining tremendous power.<04e0>The Third Committee plans to use this sword to throw<03e0>the world into further chaos, and take advantage of the<03e0>disorder to gain more power.<04e0>I believe in no uncertain terms that this sword should<03e0>not exist. I am heading to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Numor Mines<1ce0> at once<03e0>to see to its destruction.
Mmm, so, as I recall, you were involved in this matter<03e0>from the beginning. Wouldn't you like to see the end?
However, if you are to come, you will have to make<03e0>certain to pull your own weight. Well?<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm ready!<09e008e0010000000300>I need some time to prepare.
Hmph, then you shall come with me.<03e0>Remember, I gave you a fair warning<03e0>of the dangers that may fall upon us.
You should always be prepared.<03e0>I shall wait for you, but make haste.
Hmph, I recall your involvement with <1be064f4ecff>Leithion's Sword<1ce003e0>from the beginning.<03e0>Wouldn't you like to see it to the end?
However, if you are to come, you will have to do your<03e0>part. I am headed to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Numor Mines<1ce0> to see to its<03e0>destruction. Are you coming with me?<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm ready!<09e008e0010000000300>I need some time to prepare.
Hmph, then you shall come with me.<03e0>Remember, I gave you a fair warning<03e0>of the dangers that may fall upon us.
You should always be prepared.<03e0>I shall wait for you, but make haste.
You have proved yourselves as great soldiers. We would<03e0>not have been successful without your help.<04e0>However, my emissaries inform me of slightly unusual<03e0>activity in the area. I will stay and rid this land of it all.
I am indebted to you.<03e0>I will offer my assistance if ever it is necessary.<04e0>Until we meet again...

The exact location of Leithion's Sword is unknown to<03e0>even my spies.
However, we have learned that it is acquiring power in<03e0>the depths of the mine.
The path to the deepest mineshaft is through that door.<03e0>Keep your eyes open and your sword close.

Duke Ghor!<03e0>We've been awaiting your arrival!<04e0>Take a look at that, my lord.
Hmph.<04e0>I take it that is Leithion's Sword.<03e0>We have no reason to search any further.
However, this place is...unusual.<03e0>Strange things are happening all around.<03e0>Please be careful, my lord.
I heard rumors of a nosy fellow trying to find out what<03e0>we were up to. I would never have dreamt it was the<03e0>Duke of Ghor.
You've seen a tad too much. There is no way we're<03e0>letting you leave here alive.<04e0>What perfect timing! I can test the powers of its Collapse!
Say your prayers!
Those who wish to create Remnants with their own<03e0>hands are ignorant fools.<04e0>This weapon, Leithion's Sword, is much too dangerous<03e0>to be wielded by anyone.<04e0>Its very existence is a danger. It must be destroyed<03e0>immediately.
Let us return.
I came with four others to scout the area, and before<03e0>I knew it, I was standing here alone.
Well, I know an escape route, so I'm not too worried.
I was following a suspicious-looking yama fellow, but I<03e0>lost sight of him somewhere.
Would you like to go back?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah, I think so.<09e008e0010000000300>Nuh-uh!
Duke Ghor!<03e0>There's a shifty-looking yama up ahead.<03e0>Please be careful!
Perhaps you should return to make preparations?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah, I think I will.<09e008e0010000000300>Nuh-uh!

Eh? This was not here before.<04e0>The Collapse must have caused<03e0>this area to become unstable.<04e0>We have no choice but to search for<03e0>another path to the sword.
How odd.<03e0>This area seems so familiar...
My, are you lost?<03e0>Would you like a portal?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yes, please...<09e008e0010000000300>Pfft, I'm fine!
What is this spatial distortion?<03e0>Could this be the effects of<03e0>Leithion's Sword?
This place is dangerous.<03e0>You have the choice to go back<03e0>if you wish.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah, I think I will.<09e008e0010000000300>I'm fine, I'm fine.

Rush...do you have a moment?<04e0>...
Sorry,<03e0>let's not talk here.
I had the urge to come here, but...<03e0>Of course, she's not back yet.
Rush. I wanted to ask you if...
...Heard that, did you?<04e0>...
Lady Emma!
What is it?
S-sir!<03e0>In the <1be0ffbe34ff>Robelia Ruins<1ce007f0> A huge monster<07f003e0>A-a giant! A giant appeared!<04e0>It seemed like it was under somebody's control...<03e0>It went straight to attack the Athlum soldiers!
Understood. I'll leave at once.
I'm sure you heard that. We can continue our<03e0>previous talk after I take care of this.
Actually, Rush, will you help me check this out?<06e0000008e0000000000000>As if you could stop me!<09e008e0010000000300>Uhh...umm... Huh....
Good. I appreciate it.<03e0>Let's hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Robelia Ruins<1ce0>.
There's no time for dilly-dallying. Come back<03e0>when you've made a decision.
It seems that a monster has appeared in<03e0>the <1be0ffbe34ff>ruins of Robelia Castle<1ce0>.
I shall be heading out to get it under control...<03e0>Rush, will you come along?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah, I'll help!<09e008e0010000000300>Uhh... Err... You see...
Good. I appreciate it.<03e0>Let's hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Robelia Ruins<1ce0>.
We don't have time for this, Rush. Stop acting<03e0>like a child and make a decision.
You alright? That became more difficult than I'd<03e0>expected.<04e0>However, this sort of incident is increasingly<03e0>common of late. Any time that you can lend us<03e0>an extra blade is much appreciated.
Then. If you'd allow me to go back to what we were<03e0>talking about before we left... I had a favor to ask of you.
Ahh, where to begin...
Here<07f0>this plaza, in front of the Valeria Heart<07f0>is<03e0>a very...dear place for me.<04e0>Quite a long time ago, I saw off a traveler from this<03e0>very spot. We promised to meet here when her travels<03e0>were done.<04e0>I don't know when she'll return, but I can't help but<03e0>wait. I know that if I wait long enough, someday, she'll<03e0>return...
However, with the increase in incidents outside of<03e0>Athlum that need my attention, I can't very well spend<03e0>all my time here.
That brings me to what I wish to ask. If she returns<03e0>and I cannot, could you be here to meet her?<04e0>You'll know who I'm talking about at first sight.<03e0>You may as well look forward to it.
Here...payment in advance.<03e0>Sorry for the trouble... I'm depending on you.

Lady Emma! Over here!
The giant is in a hall further into the ruins. To get there,<03e0>you have to take a secret passage on the second floor.
You can take this ladder up to the second floor.
So, you're the one behind all this...<03e0>Surrender your weapons at once unless<03e0>you wish for me to take them by force.
Oho! If it isn't the ever lovely and genial<03e0>General Honeywell.
Lively, aren't you, with all your demands...<03e0>Well, I have a demand of you as well:<04e0>Return to Athlum, and open the front gate.
That will make it a lot easier for us to walk<03e0>right in and take over.
Just a tip: instead of wasting your lives and my time<03e0>trying to resist us, it would be most prudent if you left<03e0>the ruins right now.
What are you hiding?
Hiding? Oh no, my dear lady...
I believe I have something that belongs to you...
L-Lady Emma...
Now you understand, don't you?<03e0>Go home, General.
...No.
Oho?<03e0>Are you sure you want to do that?<04e0>If you don't do as I say, I'm afraid I cannot guarantee<03e0>the...shall we say, physical integrity of this poor boy.<03e0>I hope my meaning is clear.
Crystal. You're under the illusion that I'd allow scum<03e0>like you to do as you please.
I am a soldier of Athlum. No matter the cost, I'll never<03e0>do anything to endanger her. Protecting Athlum is my<03e0>sworn duty.
Oh! What a revoltingly loyal statement. But I fear your<03e0>words are only worth the paper they're written on.
I wonder if your tune will change once this boy is dead.<03e0>Do you really want his blood on your hands?
Hmph. I tire of your dramatics. Besides, I told you<07f003e0>soldiers of Athlum do not bow to threats!
Can you hold on a bit longer?
Yes, ma'am!
Good.<03e0>Let's go, Rush!
That black-cloaked man... What did he really<03e0>think he was going to do? We were able to stop<03e0>him this time, but he still caught us off-guard.
You alright?
Yes, ma'am!<03e0>I'm sorry for causing this trouble...
It's nothing.<03e0>Let's just be happy you're alright.
Lady Emma!
We're finished here. Make certain everyone's received<03e0>the first aid they need, then let's get out of here.
Yes, ma'am!

Lady Emma<07f003e0>Before you go, one more thing...
The giant was way too much for us, so we scattered...<03e0>But one of the men didn't make it.<04e0>We tried to go find him<07f0>we heard yelling, and sounds<03e0>of a struggle, but never saw him at all.<04e0>I hope he's alright...

Hello, traitor.
Allan.<03e0>We have not talked in 80 years,<03e0>and that is how you greet me?
It has only been 80 years.<03e0>You have gotten too used to the mitra way.<03e0>80 years is but a mere minute for us, fool.
You've always grown hostile when you needed to ask<03e0>a favor. What is it?
Hah!<03e0>I would never ask you for anything.
A group of armed soldiers has appeared, calling<03e0>themselves the Steel Syndicate. They need to be<03e0>disposed of. Now.<04e0>I assumed you would want to tag along.
I see.<03e0>Most certainly something must be done about them.<03e0>Rush, will you lend a hand?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Of course!<09e008e0010000000300>Nah, not right now.
I appreciate it.
Hmph!<03e0>Asking a mitra for help...<04e0>I'll be waiting at the <1be0ffbe34ff>Gaslin Caves<1ce0>.
Hmph.
How the mighty have fallen, Torgal. I'd think that you<03e0>of all people would know that mitra are selfish and<03e0>cannot be trusted.
This new "Steel Syndicate" needs to disappear.<03e0>Don't keep me waiting long.
Will you lend a hand?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Of course!<09e008e0010000000300>Nah, not right now.
Your assistance is appreciated.
Hmph!<03e0>Asking a mitra for help...<04e0>I'll be waiting at the <1be0ffbe34ff>Gaslin Caves<1ce0>.
Hmph.
Hah!<03e0>Mitra are selfish and cannot be trusted, Torgal.
I only have myself to blame for the arrogance<03e0>of these mitra.
Before Athlum was ruled by David, Torgal was<03e0>taken in as a general to commend his contribution<03e0>for maintaining public order and peace.<04e0>But I believed that we could bring peace<03e0>to the whole world, not just Athlum.<04e0>The Steel Syndicate grew, but gained nothing<03e0>but useless soldiers in it for the fame.<04e0>And now they've become an uncontrollable<03e0>group of violent warriors slaying everything in<03e0>sight, justifying it by throwing around the word "justice."
Torgal forcefully disbanded the organization,<03e0>but its soul lives on.<04e0>To the triflingly short-lived mitra,<03e0>50 years is enough for ideology to<03e0>become legend<07f0>to become convention.<04e0>My duty is to destroy it all.
There are also realist organizations<03e0>like the Silver Falcons.<03e0>Race makes no difference in this matter.
But don't forget<07f0>the leader of<03e0>the Silver Falcons is a sovani.
Organizations change with time.<03e0>Who knows what the Silver Falcons will become?<03e0>Sovani live longer. That's all.
You were always a strange one.<03e0>The sovani way is to not care about others.
I could say the same to you.
Hmph.<03e0>I merely like the taste of blood.<03e0>I have no interest in political matters.<04e0>But I suppose I owe you.<03e0>If you ever need anything, come<03e0>to the guild.

Busy at work, I see.
Who goes there!? We are the Steel Syndicate! We bring<03e0>justice to the world by ridding it of evil and sin!
Justice?<03e0>Is that what you call it?<03e0>You're nothing but a bunch of fools.
Though your intentions may be good, we<03e0>must force you to disband.
You're Torgal, one of the Four Generals of Athlum.<04e0>This is perfect.<03e0>With all the meaningless wars Athlum keeps waging,<03e0>I can't think of a better enemy to destroy!<04e0>Let's go, men!<03e0>We're off to destroy that enemy of justice, Athlum!
We must crush them before they reach Athlum.<03e0>Ignore the weaklings.<04e0>Come on!
I don't remember letting them escape being part of the<03e0>plan. Athlum is your city, isn't it? If you want to defend<03e0>it, we have to move faster!<04e0>Ignore the weaklings!
You call that a battle worthy of the Steel Syndicate?
D-damn, you're strong...
You bring shame to the Syndicate.
What right do you have to say that!?<03e0>The organization's purpose is to bring peace<03e0>to the world. That's what we're doing!
You half-wit!<03e0>You mitra are all feebleminded.
The Steel Syndicate was created by<03e0>two sovani. <03e0>We were but a mere vigilante group.<04e0>It is not a means to justify your<03e0>thoughtless and brutal acts of violence.<04e0>I can't stand by and watch idiots<03e0>ruin its name.
W-wait, what do you mean?<03e0>A-are you...? Are you!?
It belongs to us and we're taking it back.
Torgal, take out this trash.
Hey!<03e0>They're gonna get away if you leave!<03e0>Is that what you want!?

Goodness... So the day has finally come when<03e0>the home of the Heroes Exemplar is Athlum.<04e0>We certainly have come a long way, my town and I.

They'll be facing the Ferocious Lion!<03e0>The battles here are beginning to heat up, folks!
And finally, we near the end of this tourney of<03e0>tourneys... Soon we'll learn who will gain glory<03e0>and honor, and who will go home in disgrace!

Hum hum...!?<03e0>I know that fine qsiti... That large, reticent mouth,<03e0>the laugh lines around the eyes...<04e0>Pagus...is that you?
W-well. Life brings us many things, you see...<03e0>More importantly! Pagus!<04e0>Have you heard about Sibal?<03e0>Apparently, he's come across something so<03e0>incredible that you will not believe your ears.
It is... The Arco Iris. The famed Remnant said to<03e0>bring miracles to life.<03e0>Goodness, we searched for it for ages...
My word, and the stories around it<07f0>!<04e0>Discovered hundreds of years ago by the famed<03e0>Duke Gulaaj, who, just as his dukedom was<03e0>about to be destroyed by a tsunami,<05e00100>used the miracles granted by the Remnant<03e0>to not only survive, but conquer and absorb the<03e0>surrounding kingdoms.<05e00100>His accomplishments from then on are the<03e0>stuff of legend...
Indeed, that's what he says.<03e0>However, I've yet to hear the particulars of<03e0>how it all came about...<04e0>It seems Sibal's been leading an excavation team<03e0>in <1be0ffbe34ff>Royotia<1ce0>. Once I've a free moment, I've a mind<03e0>to see what he's up to myself.
Ohh<07f0>Maddox, isn't it?<03e0>Maddox, goodness me!<03e0>How long has it been? My word...<04e0>What is Celapaleis's famed general doing out here?<03e0>Though, actually, I'd heard you'd retired and become<03e0>somewhat of a recluse.
I won't?<03e0>...No...it couldn't be...!
And in the end, Sibal actually saw it?<03e0>He saw the Arco Iris with his own two eyes?
The ancient Remnant of legend, Arco Iris...<03e0>To think it truly exists...!
Goodness, I've got the old butterflies in my<03e0>stomach<07f0>I haven't felt that in years! Once I<03e0>have a chance, I'll certainly go to see Sibal!
Oh, hello, Rush.<03e0>Maddox is an old, old school friend.<04e0>Years ago, we and a third, Sibal, met in a<03e0>seminar studying ancient civilizations.
Back then, the three of us were obsessed with<03e0>old legends, especially those centered around<03e0>the Arco Iris.<04e0>It is a famous Remnant said to have granted<03e0>miracles to the people of the Old Kingdoms.
And just now, Maddox says that Sibal's found the<03e0>real thing.<04e0>The Remnant powerful enough to create<03e0>miracles... Seeing it with my own eyes has<03e0>been my dream since I was a student.
Rush, my boy, I realize it's the foolish conceit<03e0>of an old man, but I've a personal favor to ask<03e0>of you, if you've the time...
Would you come with me to where Sibal is?<03e006e0000008e0000000000000>Sounds cool! Let's check it out!<09e008e0010000000300>Ehh, do we have to do it now?
Thank you, lad! It's much appreciated.<03e0>Sibal is in the mining capital of <1be0ffbe34ff>Royotia<1ce0>, south of<03e0>even the great desert.
Goodness, I haven't seen Sibal in years.<03e0>I'm giddy as a schoolgirl!
Ahh. I apologize for the sudden request. I know<03e0>you young people have things to do.<03e0>However, if you're free later, please let me know.

Eh? Those crow's-feet and that giant yap...<04e0>Damnation, if it isn't Pagus!<03e0>Cripes, you're a sight for sore eyes!
Darned tooting I do!<03e0>And I've sure got reason for it, you know! I've<03e0>only made the biggest discovery of the century!<04e0>Pagus<07f0>you're gonna flip when you hear this,<03e0>but<07f001e00be00ae0>
Maddox! Gabbering God Emperors, you just took<03e0>ten years off my life!<04e0>But huh! I've got not only one of Athlum's Four<03e0>Generals come to see me, but an ex-general of<03e0>the Celapaleian Army! The star power!
The Arco Iris is a Remnant that takes the form<03e0>of a seven-colored light.<04e0>The old stories say that the guy what had it<03e0>was granted all kinds of miracles.<04e0>As for me... Well, I was digging in <1be0ffbe34ff>Siebenbur<1ce003e0>not long ago, when out of the blue, I'm hit by<03e0>this dazzling beam of light.<04e0>Thing is, I was deep underground, way past<03e0>any place the sun could hit, see?
It's just like all the history books said...<03e0>A rainbow of light shot straight over my head.<04e0>I...I can't even begin to describe how beautiful it was...<03e0>Something that stunning could only be the work of<03e0>the gods.
Whaaat? You calling me a liar!?
Reckon so. Just, you can't right now.<03e0>Some huge monster's taken the place as its lair.<03e004e0>Until somebody cleans the place out, you've got more<03e0>of a chance of seeing the inside of the monster's<03e0>belly than seeing the Arco Iris.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Then call me "the Cleaninator"!<09e008e0010000000300>(This sounds kinda scary...)
Right, kid<07f0>if somethin's in the way, mow<03e0>it down, eh?<04e0>But if you think you can underestimate this<03e0>bugger, you're in for a rude surprise, kiddo.
The miners of Royotia<07f0>no slouches in the<03e0>physical power department<07f0>have tangled with<03e0>the thing more than a couple times...<04e0>They haven't won once. Don't go off half-cocked,<03e0>alright, kid? You'll regret it.
(Meaning...)<03e006e0000008e0000000000000>Kill the monster, see the Remnant!<09e008e0010000000300>(I'll leave it to these guys.)
Enough theatrics, Sibal, I've already told him.
Come now, are you certain you didn't just<03e0>spend too much time underground and started<03e0>seeing things? Lack of oxygen, perhaps?
If we go there, we should be able to see the<03e0>Arco Iris as well, correct?
Sibal! It's been thirty years...far too long.<03e0>You look well<07f0>high-spirited as always!
Maddox, Sibal, please!<03e0>Let's try to act our age, shall we?
Still. To think that the Remnant of Miracles is real...<04e0>Sibal, you've been able to taste a part of a<03e0>legend over 640 years old. Dear me,<03e0>you've really done something incredible!
Gahahah! Send your kids out here anytime!<03e0>Throw 'em in the mines, I'll look after 'em for you!
Eheh, sorry about that...
Say, kid<07f0>ah, Rush. Sorry for the trouble<07f0>I've<03e0>put you through a lot, eh?
I know he's a meddlesome old coot, but take<03e0>good care of Pagus for me, would you?
Well! I certainly hadn't felt that sort of fear<03e0>or excitement in a long while.<04e0>Truly, I mustn't forget to teach my subordinates<03e0>that experience is just as important as book<03e0>knowledge.
Pagus. Rush. I'll be returning to Melphina,<03e0>then. Pagus<07f0>whenever you have a chance, please<03e0>come and visit.
Sibal, you'd do well to take care of yourself...<03e0>We might not be there next time you're about<03e0>to be eaten by monsters.
Alright, lad.<03e0>It's time we returned to Melphina as well.
Some giant monster's moved into the cave where<03e0>I saw the Arco Iris<07f0>and it seemed hungry.<04e0>So long as the monster's there, there's no way<03e0>we can go look for the Remnant.<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'll take care of that thing!<09e008e0010000000300>Monsters don't sound like fun...
The miners of Royotia<07f0>no slouches in the<03e0>physical power department<07f0>have tangled with<03e0>the thing more than a couple times...<04e0>They haven't won once. Don't go off half-cocked,<03e0>alright, kid? You'll regret it.
What's wrong, kid, scared of the big bad monster?<04e0>...I was, and that's why I didn't even try getting<03e0>close!
Oho, it's the kid again! I figured you an' Pagus<03e0>couldn't commit and went back to Athlum already!<04e0>Don't tell me you're gonna go back to the cave<03e0>to try and see the Arco Iris, are you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>That monster's toast!<09e008e0010000000300>(Going home sounds good.)

Darned tooting we will!<03e0>Like we could just leave Pagus alone in a<03e0>dangerous place like this!
...'Sides, we can't let Pagus and the kid walk<03e0>off with all the glory, eh?
Yoo-hoo, Pagus, you here?<04e0>Don't tell me he's already taken out the<03e0>monster!
Lavafender's blustering hells...!<04e0>I heard the monster was supposed to be big,<03e0>but this is just ridiculous!
Pagus!
Darned tooting we did!<04e0>We're talking about the Arco Iris here...<03e0>If all three of us can't see it together,<03e0>what's the point?
But, seems like Maddox was right about it after<03e0>all... I guess I just imagined seeing it.
I was so certain I saw the Arco Iris...<04e0>Ha, but there's nothing here now, huh...
Geh! Pagus, you keep going around saying stuff<03e0>like that, I'll get all misty-eyed... *sniff*
Welp, at the very least we took out that<03e0>massive monster, eh? C'mon, let's get back to<03e0>Royotia.
You too, kiddo!<03e0>I'll treat you to dinner or something!
Hum...<03e0>So, we're to sneak into the cave as well?
Hahaha, I agree with you there!<03e0>This reminds me of our<03e0>adventures back then...<04e0>...Alright. Into the breach! To the Arco Iris.
Mmm, that would be an astonishing feat indeed!
Of course, as the former general of Celapaleis's<03e0>Third Division, defeating monsters like this would<03e0>be as easy as taking candy from a baby...
Erm. Perhaps "baby" isn't quite the<03e0>correct term...
Pagus!
Sibal...
...That is the miracle given us by the Arco Iris?
Maddox! Sibal! Fear not, I'm here to save you!
Are you two alright!?<03e0>Goodness me, I didn't think you'd follow us...
No... Certainly, you met the Remnant of<03e0>Miracles, Sibal.
Maddox...Sibal... The time we three were<03e0>engrossed in the mystery of the Arco Iris is<03e0>many years past.
As time passed, we went our separate ways, doing<03e0>different things and living different lives, perhaps<03e0>never to meet again...<04e0>And yet here we are, on an adventure, at that!<03e0>It really brings back memories, doesn't it?
Ahem. My point here is, just the fact that we're<03e0>all here together again...

Pagus. Rush. I'd better be getting back, then.<03e0>Pagus<07f0>let's do a better job of keeping in touch<03e0>this time, hmm?
Sibal, you'd do well to take care of yourself...<03e0>We might not be there next time you're about<03e0>to be eaten by monsters.
Alright, lad.<03e0>It's time we returned to Melphina as well.
Ahh... For a moment, I was back as a young man<03e0>having a great adventure... It's not a feeling<03e0>I'll soon forget.

Oh, hi, Rush.<04e0>...<04e0>I just received a letter, challenging<03e0>the head of the Honeywell clan<03e0>to a duel.
Our family is known for being the greatest<03e0>of warriors. People far and wide<03e0>come to challenge the Honeywells.
Warrior Yerva...<03e0>There isn't a soldier alive who doesn't know that name.<04e0>This is my first duel defending the Honeywell name.<03e0>I cannot afford to lose.
Watch over me, Mother.
Rush, will you come with me to witness<03e0>the duel?<06e0000008e0000000000000>If you want me to.<09e008e0010000000300>Sounds boring.
Thanks, Rush.
Let's head to <1be0ffbe34ff>Aveclyff<1ce0>.
Alright. I understand.

Alright. I understand.
...
Will I ever surpass Mother?
Everyone I talk to sees my mother<03e0>in me. I understand, because I carry<03e0>a big part of her with me.
But will the day ever come when<03e0>people see me for me?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Of course!<09e008e0010000000000>Probably not...
Thanks. I know that's what Mother<03e0>would want for me, too.
It's not an easy task, trying to<03e0>surpass Mother...
Here. A little token of my appreciation.<03e0>Thank you, Rush.
Let's go.

Fellow soldier.<03e0>Make your way to the farthest room.<03e0>That is where I shall wait.<04e0>The elevation devices now function<03e0>properly. They will help save your strength<03e0>for when we duel.
You've finally arrived, Emma Honeywell.<03e0>Let's begin.
Hm?<03e0>You seem very young, child. Do you claim to be<03e0>Emma Honeywell, the head of the Honeywell clan?
I am Emma Honeywell II.<03e0>I bring with me my mother's sword as<03e0>proof of my heritage.
Hrmph.<03e0>I had my sights set on fighting a real<03e0>soldier, not some child...
I understand your disappointment.<04e0>However, you must see me fight before<03e0>deeming me an unworthy opponent.
I like your spirit.<03e0>Then let us begin!
Grah...!<03e0>Y-you are much stronger than you<03e0>appear to be...
I fought a fair battle.<03e0>I have yet to live up to becoming one<03e0>worthy of wielding this sword.
I still have a long journey ahead.
Oh?<04e0>Hahaha!<03e0>You are young and yet so sensible.<03e0>The future looks bright for you.
You can find me in Virtus Parish<03e0>in Athlum. My fellow mercenaries and<03e0>I will be there if you need anything.
Thank you, Warrior Yerva.<03e0>It is an honor to be rewarded with<03e0>such an opportunity.

Rush, thanks for coming.<03e0>I wanted to ask something of you before the others<03e0>get back.<04e0>I know this is short notice, but would you accompany<03e0>me to <1be0ffbe34ff>Fornstrand<1ce0>? We have a bit of free time, and<03e0>there is someone I am quite overdue to meet.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah, why not?<09e008e0010000000300>Sorry, Dave. It's too far.
Thank you, Rush.<04e0>Ferocious monsters spawn in <1be0ffbe34ff>Fornstrand<1ce003e0>this time of year.<03e0>We must be careful.
Oh...<03e0>Well, I'm sure you're busy.<03e0>Sorry for bothering you.
Would you accompany me to <1be0ffbe34ff>Fornstrand<1ce0>?<03e0>There's someone I want to catch up with while<03e0>I have some free time.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, why not?<09e008e0010000000300>Sorry, Dave. It's too far.
Thank you for accompanying me.<04e0>This isn't much, but please<03e0>take this.
Athlum has just barely begun to<03e0>hold her own.<04e0>With the help of everyone, I want to turn<03e0>her into a city that will be looked up to and admired.

We'll find her here.
Let's go.
This is exactly the way I remember it...
Five years ago, this was my place<03e0>to hide from the world.<04e0>I was angry for being born<03e0>a Nassau.<04e0>A marquis is responsible for everything.<03e0>The title was nothing but a burden.<04e0>Childish, I know.<04e0>That's when I met a little girl.<04e0>She was my age and lived on the outskirts<03e0>of town.<03e0>Apparently, this was her hideout, too.<04e0>We became friends and spent a lot<03e0>of time together here.<04e0>I was always surrounded by adults<03e0>and it was refreshing to be able to speak<03e0>to someone my age.<04e0>Even after she found out who I was,<03e0>she never treated me differently.

"Nothing bad can happen to Athlum<03e0>if you're in charge."
That's what she said to me one day.<04e0>I think I nodded in reply<03e0>with a wry smile.<04e0>As long as Athlum was ruled by Celapaleis,<03e0>there was always a chance we would go to war.<04e0>A small country like Athlum would never<03e0>gain independence. Ever.<04e0>At least, that's how I used to think.<04e0>But I was glad that she had faith in me.<03e0>I felt reassured.<04e0>That day, we made our usual promise to meet up<03e0>again and went our separate ways.<04e0>But then she stopped coming.<03e0>I haven't seen her in a long, long time.
Let's go.<03e0>It's up ahead.
The night of our last meeting,<03e0>a slew of monsters attacked Athlum.<04e0>I quickly gathered our troops, but<03e0>I was too late.<03e0>The monsters had gotten into town.<04e0>If only I hadn't needed permission to use<03e0>the Gae Bolg, I might have been able<03e0>to prevent the invasion.<04e0>But I had to prioritize the treaty with<03e0>Celapaleis over the townspeoples' lives.<04e0>As a result, there were several casualties.<03e0>She was one of them.<04e0>I've never felt so helpless.<03e0>A ruler who couldn't even save the life of<03e0>one girl...
I know it's been a while since I've come back.<03e0>I'm sorry for the wait.<04e0>I couldn't bring myself to come,<03e0>even though I knew you were here.<04e0>I promised myself I would come back<03e0>when I was worthy<07f0>when Athlum<03e0>became the country you hoped it would be.
Athlum's gained its independence.<03e0>I know it's a small step forward,<03e0>but it's a step nonetheless.<04e0>It's all because of your words<03e0>that I was able to come this far.
I've been meaning to tell you something<07f003e0>something I promised myself I would<03e0>tell you the next time we met.
Thank you.<03e0>And...

You've forgotten?<03e0>We met at the Academy some time ago...<04e0>I'm Haruko, Remnant researcher.<03e0>It's nice to meet you...again.
Quite a lot has happened since I saw you last.<03e0>I don't work for the Academy anymore, for one.<04e0>Not being able to participate in the Academy's<03e0>research is...well, it hurts a bit.<04e0>Then again, since being named director, I<03e0>never had much time for research anyway.<03e0>In a way, I suppose it works out.<04e0>So...

Oh, Rush!<03e0>How wild to run into you here!<04e0>I'm sure you've seen the floating stones throughout<03e0>town many times, right? All those little<07f0>and sometimes<03e0>large<07f0>rocks make up the Remnant Umbermarici.<04e0>I wonder how it came to be that so many different<03e0>physical pieces were recognized as one single Remnant?<03e0>It's like empty space means nothing to them...<04e0>Those who bind Remnants sacrifice some of their<03e0>souls in exchange for their use. This means there<03e0>must be some sort of unseen connection, right?<04e0>It's easy to only look at the benefits Remnants give<03e0>us, but... I just can't do that anymore. I have to do<03e0>what I can to find the whole truth!
Oh, hello, Rush.<04e0>Have you ever heard of the mythical Remnant<03e0>of <1be0ffbe34ff>Darken Forest<1ce0>?<04e0>Actually, I have some files on the Remnant.<03e0>I, er, borrowed them from the Academy as I<03e0>left, so they are sure to be trustworthy.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Keep talking.<09e008e0010000000000>You stole top-secret docs?
Ahahah, don't worry about that.<03e0>The Academy has plenty of secret documents<03e0>left<07f0>they won't miss this one.
So, according to these files, the mythical Remnant,<03e0>Dead Heart, really does exist.<04e0>However, only the highest ranked officials in the<03e0>Academy know of its existence.<04e0>The files say it has the power to make any ideal into<03e0>reality... To literally make one's dreams come true.<04e0>It may sound like a tall tale, but if the Academy thought<03e0>it dangerous enough to hide it completely... There must<03e0>be something to it<07f0>something I want to see for myself.<04e0>However, <1be0ffbe34ff>Darken Forest<1ce0> is full of dangerous beasts.<03e0>I'd never be able to make it to the <1be064f4ecff>Dead Heart<1ce0> alone...<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'll go with you!<09e008e0010000000300>Those files are bad news.
Thank you, Rush!<03e0>Somehow, I believed you might help me in this.<04e0>Alright then, let's go!
Maybe...but I'm not giving them back.<03e0>A Remnant with this much power should not be hidden<03e0>away as the secret playthings of some elite group.<04e0>I'll be here a bit longer. If you change your mind about<03e0>going, let me know.
You see that chick in the white? I seen her 'round here<03e0>a lot lately. You ain't trying to hook up or anythin', are<03e0>you?<04e0>Not so long ago, some shady types in black robes<03e0>came through askin' about her. Looks like she's bad<03e0>news. I'd advise ya to keep yer hands off.
According to Academy files, the Remnant Dead Heart<03e0>really does exist.<04e0>A Remnant hidden from all but the highest ranked<03e0>officials in the Academy, and said to have the power to<03e0>grant wishes...

I believe we saw the true power of the<03e0>Dead Heart.<04e0>Just because a power is great doesn't mean it's<03e0>meant to destroy. Power is just power. For good or<03e0>ill, its result is determined by its bearer.<04e0>Plus... I'm sure that traveling with you, I'll get<03e0>to see all sorts of neat new Remnants.<03e0>That's okay with you...right?

Oh, Rush!<03e0>Funny to meet you here.<04e0>So, there used to be a massive sword-shaped<03e0>Remnant jutting from the town square.<04e0>It was called the Valeria Heart. But about six<03e0>months ago, it suddenly disappeared. What could<03e0>have happened to it?<04e0>Rush... Why do you think Remnants exist?<03e0>Are they meant to serve the world? To serve us?<03e0>Or do they have some other purpose...?

I went to see the Remnant here...<04e0>It's the Remnant of Fear, Gwayn... Its power<03e0>was so great and fierce that it razed Nagapur<03e0>in an instant.<04e0>This was the first time I'd seen the Gwayn in<03e0>person. Seeing it with my own eyes, feeling its<03e0>presence...<04e0>All I could think was that Remnants are not<03e0>meant to be our tools, or even our allies.<04e0>Like the Gwayn, they may seem quiet, or even to<03e0>watch over us, but one misstep can bring the full<03e0>brunt of that terrible power down upon us all...<04e0>Great power only leads to destruction. I wonder<03e0>if we are really meant to live alongside<03e0>Remnants as we do...

It's about time you arrived.
It's as if these lost ruins are urging us on<07f0>as if they<03e0>want us to find the Remnant.<04e0>Could this be the power of the Dead Heart?
Come on, Rush. The ruins will show us the way.

Then, this is the Dead Heart...<03e0>It feels like<07f0>like it can see straight into my soul...<03e0>It...it's unsettling...
It's just like the files said... The Remnant has the<03e0>power to take on the form we imagine it to have.<04e0>And if that's true, then Remnants are our<07f001e00be00ae0>
Yes<07f0>Remnants are ours.<03e0>Our tools, to be used as we please.
Who are you people?
I think it's high time you returned those top-<03e0>secret documents you stole from the Academy,<03e0>Ms. Former Director.<04e0>That information was not meant to be spread.<03e0>However, I think you'll find we've an efficient<03e0>way of stilling your tongue...forever.
Th-that...how...<04e0>You can't be... The Third Committee!?<03e0>...Then, the rumors of some criminal<03e0>organization within the Academy were true. <04e0>So you're the ones hiding information?
You know, curiosity killed the cat...it's only a matter<03e0>of time before it kills you, too. Thus, no one will find<03e0>it a surprise when they find your corpse!
Dammit...
What are you trying to use Remnants to do!?
Why must our pure ideal of realizing the full potential<03e0>of how we can use Remnants be limited by visionless<03e0>fools like you, who deem our actions atrocities?
Grahhh!!!
The Dead Heart!<03e0>What...what is it doing?
Remnants...<03e0>The price of great power is...<04e0>No...that can't be true.<03e0>It isn't!
I want to see it for myself... People living<03e0>in harmony with Remnants.
Dead Heart! You're the tool of no man!<03e0>But...you can't use men as tools either!<03e0>I...I cannot accept such a cruel act!
Urgh...
This... How...
Oh...<03e0>Yes...that would work.
Rush. You have the tablet, don't you? Take this<03e0>Remnant with you. If you have it, I'm sure we won't<03e0>have to worry about its misuse.

Rush! I've waited for you to come.<04e0>By asking around this very pub, I've found<03e0>what's happened to those dark-clothed<03e0>miscreants from before.
One is a qsiti named Nordis. Apparently, he<03e0>specializes in close combat with blades. The<03e0>other is a mitra named Azelle.<04e0>Word is that they've fled Melphina to Nagapur,<03e0>and are hiding out in the <1be0ffbe34ff>Numor Mines<1ce0>.
For shaming the name of the Order of Melphina,<03e0>and putting all of Melphina in danger, they have<03e0>run up a high toll I intend to collect.<04e0>The fiends must be found and brought to<03e0>justice. You agree that is the correct course,<03e0>Rush, do you not?
Come with me to find them. But we must make<03e0>haste; given the time, they will scurry off<03e0>like the rats they are.
Rush<07f0>let's go!<03e006e0000008e0000000000000>Time for frontier justice!<09e008e0010000000300>C'mon, just let 'em be.
As I had expected of you, Rush. You well<03e0>understand the concepts of honor and justice.
The blackguards should be lurking within the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Numor Mines<1ce0>. Head there as soon as you<03e0>possibly can. I shall head there as well.
What<07f0>how can you say such a thing?<04e0>...Fine. Even if I must do it alone, I will see<03e0>them punished with my own two hands. Report<03e0>to me if you change your mind.
Ooh... Rush...<04e0>It's all that man in black's fault... That Azelle,<03e0>he's the one who took the Forest Maiden, I'm<03e0>sure of it!
I'd meant to punish him for tarnishing the image<03e0>of the Order and the country, but I never<03e0>imagined something like this would happen...
I've proven myself unfit to be a knight of Melphina...<04e0>Never again will I use this blade.<03e0>Rush, if you would, I leave it to you.
I've committed an unforgivable sin. It is I who<03e0>am the true criminal...<04e0>If only I had listened to Commander Roberto...
Rush! I knew you would reconsider. Come now, let<03e0>us bring those fiends to justice!<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah! It's vigilante time!<09e008e0010000000300>Anger leads to the dark side.
I appreciate your enthusiasm.<03e0>Let's hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Numor Mines<1ce0>!

Once upon a time, in a tiny little podunk town,<03e0>there was an orphaned qsiti and mitra.<04e0>The kindly villagers all helped to raise the kids.<03e0>But as the pair grew, they got bored with their<03e0>peaceful village, and left to find their fortune.
Out in the real world without money or power,<03e0>they somehow found themselves working for<03e0>a shady organization.<04e0>And not just any mob, but a huge organization<03e0>dedicated to the development of Remnants as<03e0>weapons. You know the one.
But the jobs they were being assigned<03e0>offered lower and lower chances of coming<03e0>back alive.<04e0>Tired of an occupation that lowered one's life<03e0>expectancy, the pair went to hand in their<03e0>resignations.

And those "two" were... Well, it's<03e0>pretty obvious, isn't it? Azelle and me.
Hey, don't get me wrong. I'm not telling you<03e0>this in some bid for sympathy.<04e0>I'm not letting you guys leave here alive.
Just wanted you to realize that no matter how<03e0>low a man's fallen, he'll shoulder any burden<03e0>to be free.
Welp, that's enough yapping.<04e0>Nordis of the Third Committee is going to<03e0>finish you off, right here!
Azelle, get out of here...<03e0>Run...run far.........
Augh! Bro<07f0>Nordis!!!
No...no! NO!!!<04e0>This wasn't supposed to happen!
D-dammit! We were almost home... Nordis and<03e0>me were just gonna go back home, and<03e0>everything was gonna be okay, like it used to...
This is all your fault!<03e0>Because of you, I'll never see my brother again!<04e0>N-never...
Remember how I feel...<03e0>Someday, you'll feel this sadness for yourselves!<04e0>You will...I'll make sure you will!
Damn, he got away...!<04e0>What could that Azelle be planning? We'll have<03e0>to keep on our toes.
Ahh, at least we were able to bring one of<03e0>them to justice. Halfway done, right?<04e0>For now, let's report to Commander Roberto.<03e0>I'm certain he'll be pleased to hear this.

Ophelia! Where have you been?<03e0>Melphina's been in a state of emergency!
Leticia the Forest Maiden has been snatched away,<03e0>held captive. The kidnapper's ransom is the Blue<03e0>Elf for the Maiden's life.
The culprit seemed at his wits' end... Furthermore,<03e0>he closed his ears to all we said. We can neither<03e0>talk him down nor negotiate.
Verily, it is as you say.

Wh-what?
The Order has already considered rescuing the<03e0>girl by force, but the kidnapper is in such a<03e0>state that the wrong move could endanger the girl.
The Blue Elf is our country's greatest treasure.<03e0>However, there is nothing in this world worth<03e0>more than a life.
Protecting the lives of the people of Melphina<03e0>is my only desire.<04e0>Likewise, Roberto and the Order, holding the<03e0>souls of true knights, have fiercely protected<03e0>this country until today.

A thousand years ago, there was a great kingdom<03e0>in the desert. Its military was renowned around<03e0>the world.<04e0>And within that force was the queensguard<07f0>the<03e0>Mantroskylo.

This is...
It seems I must request a task from you.<04e0>That roar you hear is the call of this town's<03e0>protector, the Flame Guardian. I know not why,<03e0>but it seems you are being summoned.
Will you meet with the Flame Guardian?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Okay, whatever.<09e008e0010000000300>Sounds like it'll eat me...
Excellent.
Here<07f0>the key to <1be0ffbe34ff>Lavafender<1ce0>.<04e0>With this key you may open the gate my people<03e0>have long stood watch over. Proceed within to<03e0>the deepest lands.<04e0>When you reach a plaza surrounded in fire, you<03e0>may meet the Flame Guardian.
Ahem.
Speaking frankly, to my knowledge, this is the first time<03e0>the Flame Guardian has ever met with anyone not part<03e0>of the royal family.<04e0>What could she possibly want with you?
Forgive me, I'm speaking to myself.<03e0>Then go, young Sykes.
Don't be ridiculous. The Flame Guardian is a very<03e0>important person to this country. At the very least you<03e0>should hear what she has to say.
The Flame Guardian, protector of our city,<03e0>requests your presence.<04e0>I trust you will meet her?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Alright, I can do that.<09e008e0010000000300>Um, I'll pass.
Good.

Forgive me, I'm speaking to myself.<03e0>Go, young Sykes.
I see.<03e0>When you change your mind, see me.
It seems the Flame Guardian, protector of<03e0>Royotia, calls for you.
Once again, will you go to her?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Here I go...<09e008e0010000000300>No, I don't think so.
Good.<03e0>Go, young Sykes.
Hmph, leaving her waiting...<03e0>Leaving this be gives me a bad feeling...
I see.<04e0>To save my country, you must destroy this beast,<03e0>"Vespalia"...<04e0>This is the first I have ever heard of such a monster in<03e0>Royotia... But if the Guardian says so, it must be truth.
As for these Crimson Shards here, at least I may be of<03e0>assistance.<04e0>Royotia's oldest treasure is a vermillion stone that<03e0>sparkles like flame: the <1be064f4ecff>Manoryll Salia<1ce0>.<03e0>It's said to be the roc's heartbeat.<04e0>It is a fabled gem of our great nation, yet I will give it<03e0>to you.
I plead to you, Rush Sykes. Do whatever you must to<03e0>protect Royotia.
This passageway leads to the Flame Guardian. When<03e0>your preparations are complete, please use it.<04e0>Good luck, Rush Sykes. My country is in your hands.

Welcome to the depths of Royotia.
I am the Flame Guardian.<03e0>I am the watcher of Vespalia, that which would lavish<03e0>destruction upon Royotia.<04e0>I have called you here to perform a task for me.
To protect Royotia, will you destroy Vespalia?
Our time grows short. Vespalia has struggled for lifetimes<03e0>to break free from its seal. Soon it will succeed.<04e0>Once the bird awakens, it will destroy all of Royotia.
Vespalia is not only strong, but possesses incredible<03e0>fortitude. It would take a miracle to defeat it.<04e0>Nevertheless, we are not without recourse against it.
This I request.<03e0>Find the nine <1be0ffbe34ff>Crimson Shards<1ce0> scattered around this world.
If there is to be any hope of destroying Vespalia, all<03e0>nine Crimson Shards must be assembled.<04e0>The Crimson Shards are drawn to those with strong<03e0>wills. Go to the powerful of this world, and you shall<03e0>easily find the Shards.
Once collected, the Crimson Shards may be combined.<03e0>Depending on this combination, they take the form of a<03e0>shield, bangle, or blade.<04e0>And, thus equipped with Crimson Blade, Bangle, and<03e0>Shield, it should be enough...<04e0>Enough to give you the power to destroy Vespalia once<03e0>and for all.<04e0>.........
When you believe you are up to challenging Vespalia,<03e0>return to this place.
Please, aid us in this time.<03e0>You are our only hope.

I see.<03e0>Then, go.
I see.
Ohh, you've defeated Vespalia, have you?<03e0>I am incredibly thankful.<04e0>The guardian disappeared as well? Ahh...<03e0>She, too, will forever have our thanks.
Royotia has been saved, thanks to you.<04e0>This land owes you a debt. You will always be<03e0>welcome here.

Ahh...<03e0>This glimmer...<03e0>Would you show it to me?
Undoubtedly, this is one of the Crimson Shards.<03e0>I can sense the power throbbing within it.
Takshend, the shield of flame.<04e0>This shield was forged with prayers to protect<03e0>its bearer from harm. Even the strongest of<03e0>blows will be softened by this shield of wings.
Vespe, the sword of flame.<04e0>This blade is made from the talons of one split<03e0>by the contrary emotions of anger and sorrow.<03e0>Its bite is as harsh as the pain of those feelings.
Manrynell, the flame bangle.<04e0>Fire is controlled only by fire itself.<03e0>This bangle is made of a proud soul, pure as<03e0>the flames' crimson light.
You have collected the shield, sword, and<03e0>bangle now.
Thank you very much.
If you would listen, I would speak the truth of<03e0>Royotia's past, how it came to be as it is.<04e0>Of the living, only I am left who knows this<03e0>story. Long ago, in what would eventually be<03e0>called Royotia, there were twin birds.<04e0>One was called Vespalia, the other, Pivasalia.<04e0>The twin birds were as old as the world itself,<03e0>and the pair had fought for longer than<03e0>memories existed.
After an eternity, it seemed their conflict was<03e0>to come to a conclusion.<04e0>Vespalia was about to take Pivasalia's life...<04e0>Through some stroke of luck, Pivasalia was<03e0>saved by a young man passing by.
Indebted to the youth, Pivasalia began to grant<03e0>him wishes.<04e0>He needed a weapon, so it gave up its talons.<03e0>To shield the youth from fire, it gave its wings.<03e0>To master the flames, it gave him its soul.<04e0>By shaving away at the life the man had saved,<03e0>Pivasalia allowed him to destroy every obstacle<03e0>in his path.
Thus, the youth became the first ruler of that<03e0>land, and named it Royotia.<04e0>By that time, Pivasalia had given almost all it<03e0>was to the man. Without the ability to even<03e0>defend itself, it was confronted by Vespalia.<04e0>Just as Vespalia's victory seemed apparent, the<03e0>man returned, bearing the sword of talons, the<03e0>shield of wings, and the bangle of soul.<04e0>Pivasalia finally had regained its strength. At<03e0>that instant, Vespalia's fangs ripped the man<03e0>in two.
Seeing this, Pivasalia felt a bottomless sorrow<03e0>matched only by its endless rage. This strength<03e0>let it seal Vespalia within the flames.<04e0>However, the seal was not complete. There was<03e0>still not power enough to completely seal<03e0>Vespalia away.<04e0>Knowing that far in the future, the seal would<03e0>break, Pivasalia looked to the man's corpse,<03e0>and swore to dedicate itself to his town.<04e0>Thus, in preparation for what it knew must<03e0>come, it plucked its feathers, cut its talons,<03e0>and transformed them all to small, red stones.
That finished, the bird's spirit flew deep<03e0>beneath the man's kingdom, to stand vigil over<03e0>where Vespalia was sealed.
And there the story ends.<03e0>By now, it seems no different from any other tale.<04e0>Still, it pleases me that it could finally be told.<03e0>Thank you.
Will you challenge Vespalia?<04e0>Losing means an end to the futures of all<03e0>Royotia's people. It is not something that can<03e0>be undone.
And yet...<03e0>And yet, will you fight?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Let me at 'im!<09e008e0010000000300>Not right now, no.
Understood. If that is what you decide, I will<03e0>stand by you.
Then, go!
I see...you exercise caution; that is wise.<03e0>Still, time grows short. Return as soon as you<03e0>can!
Thank you for all you've done. Now, the town he<03e0>worked so hard to build will not be destroyed...<04e0>My job here is complete as well.<03e0>For your help, please take this.
Thank you. You have saved Royotia.
And I as well...
You are the only thing standing between Royotia<03e0>and certain destruction.<04e0>Are you prepared to face Vespalia?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Ready as I'll ever be...<09e008e0010000000000>I need to return to Royotia.<09e008e0020000000300>Still got something to do...
Understood.<03e0>When your preparations are complete, return to me.
Once you are fully prepared,<03e0>please let me know.

Leshau, a monster hunt?<03e0>Are you certain?
Yes, yes, yes!<03e0>It has to be slain!<06e0000008e0000000000000>What kind of monster?<09e008e0010000000000>(I don't want to get involved.)
Why hello, traveler!<03e0>What monster, you ask?<04e0>There's a monster called Validus in the <1be0ffbe34ff>Vale of<03e0>the Gods<1ce0>... It's causing quite a ruckus!
It's never acted this way before...
But it's acting this way now! A bunch of travelers<03e0>have already been found<07f0>all in bits and pieces!
Hey, Mr. Traveler.<03e0>You look like a nice, strong fellow!<04e0>Come with me to take care of Validus! If we don't,<03e0>who knows what'll happen to Baaluk...<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm game!<09e008e0010000000300>Nah.
I knew I could count on you!<03e0>C'mon, let's go!
If you insist on doing this, I wish you luck.<03e0>Be careful out there.
B-but we've gotta save Baaluk!
Baaluk is done for!
I don't care much for monster hunts...
Don't you care what happens to Baaluk?<04e0>You there, traveler!<03e0>Help me slay Validus!<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm game!<09e008e0010000000300>Nah.
I knew I could count on you!<03e0>Let's be off!
If you insist on doing this, I wish<03e0>you luck. Be careful out there.
B-but we've gotta save Baaluk!
See? Even a hardy-looking type like that traveler<03e0>bailed on you.
No... I'm sure he just wasn't finished getting ready!<04e0>Oh<07f0>hey Mr. Traveler!<03e0>You will come with me to slay Validus now,<03e0>won't you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm game!<09e008e0010000000300>Nah.
Alright! We're off!
If you insist on going, I can't stop you.<03e0>Be safe out there.
B-but we've gotta save Baaluk!

Hey, Leshau!<03e0>Where have you been!?
Some Academy guys came out of nowhere and...
The Brimuslabus was stolen.<03e0>Baaluk is done for...
Everything's fine!
A Collapse was coming.<03e0>Baaluk has been saved from disaster!
It is true that the Brimuslabus hasn't been bound<03e0>to anyone since its last keeper passed away...
What? That's your reason? I've been telling you<03e0>all this time, make me the ruler so I could bind<03e0>the Brimuslabus to myself!
N-no way!<03e0>You just want to use it to expand your domain!<03e0>I should be the one to...
A clown like yourself can't bring prosperity<03e0>to Baaluk!
That's why...!
That's why I asked the Academy to take<03e0>the Brimuslabus away.<04e0>Neither of you are fit to be the lord!<04e0>And with the Collapse...!
The Remnant brings ill fortune to Baaluk.<04e0>Ridding the town of it was the best move.<03e0>We don't need a Remnant or a lord for this town<03e0>to flourish!
What did you do...?
I think Leshau has a point...
No Remnant.<03e0>No lord.<03e0>How can you be certain we'll be fine?
I know we will!<03e0>We just all have to work together!
Rush, I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you about<03e0>what I was planning.<04e0>Please, take this as an apology and a reward<03e0>for saving Baaluk from danger.
Perhaps you're right. If we all work together...<03e0>You must show people how it's done, Leshau!<03e0>You must set an example.
Of course! I'll do anything for this town!
Rush, if you ever need me, go to the guild!

Sonny! You knew about that monster, right? The<03e0>one what fought some ancient hero for decades<03e0>before being sealed beneath the desert?<04e0>Thing is, it seems like the monster has been<03e0>brought back. Luckily, it hasn't started making<03e0>too much trouble just yet.<04e0>Still, a bunch of shady-looking out-of-towners<03e0>have been skulking around lately, and they sure<03e0>look like they want trouble<07f0>monster trouble.<04e0>I heard this ancient hero was resurrected to boot.<03e0>The whole thing stinks of conspiracy, I tell ya!<03e0>And it's gotta be stopped before it goes too far.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Call me the Stopmaster!<09e008e0010000000300>Zombies sound scary...

Once, there was a different kingdom on this<03e0>land. Within that kingdom was a legendary<03e0>warrior who sealed many heinous monsters.<04e0>However, after being killed in his battle against<03e0>the last monster, he ended up turning into the<03e0>undead himself.

Cool! So, there're a bunch of pillars set up in<03e0>the desert to keep you from getting lost. And<03e0>they've all got IDs on them if you look close.<04e0>If you look at them in the order:<03e0>C-4-B-E-A-1<03e0>then...

Ah, you're finally here! Do you know how long I've been<03e0>waiting? Anyway<07f0>no time for that! I need you<03e0>to get moving to the site.<04e0>...What? Why do you wear that ridiculously baffled<03e0>expression? ...Ugh, this WOULD be what I get when I<03e0>ask for the best...<04e0>The reason you have come here is to be my assistant.<03e0>So, as I said, get going to the place you need to be<03e0>assisting me at!<04e0>Head to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Yvalock's Nest<1ce0>.<03e0>The plants that grow there are the key<03e0>ingredient in my secret elixir!<04e0>I need <1be064f4ecff>10 drops of Blackrose Nectar<1ce0>,<03e01be064f4ecff>8 flasks of Parasitic Oil<1ce0>, and <1be064f4ecff>5 Shadowood Seeds.<1ce004e0>Yes...with the mere addition of those three<03e0>ingredients, this soon-to-be panacea of the world's<03e0>ills will be complete!<04e0>Time and tide wait for no man<07f0>and neither will I!<03e0>Get going! Honestly, your first day, and already<03e0>slacking...!<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'll get your plants, geez.<09e008e0010000000300>W-wait a minute!
*chuckle* I see you realize your meager paycheck hangs<03e0>in the balance.<04e0>Now! Go forth, trusted assistant #1! With youthful vigor,<03e0>make haste and collect the ingredients for my special<03e0>elixir!
This is not the time to reveal yourself as the idiot you<03e0>apparently are<07f0>this is the time for action!<04e0>But...I realize not everyone is blessed with as piercingly<03e0>logical a brain as I. Fine, I will give your poor, taxed mind<03e0>a minute to catch up.<04e0>...<04e0>...<04e0>........................
There, I've waited enough!<03e0>Now, annoyingly unreliable assistant #1: go forth,<03e0>and collect the ingredients of my elixir!
What's this? You still don't have my ingredients?<03e0>If you don't hurry and gather them, you're fired,<03e0>I tell you! Fired!<04e0>I need <1be064f4ecff>10 drops of Blackrose Nectar<1ce0>,<03e01be064f4ecff>8 flasks of Parasitic Oil<1ce0>, and <1be064f4ecff>5 Shadowood Seeds.<1ce004e0>I shouldn't think it's too much to remember,<03e0>even for you. So, hurry up and get them!
It took you long enough!<03e0>Now, my precious ingredients, you will show me them!<03e0>Do it! Every last one!<04e0>Ohhh...look at them, they're beautiful...<03e0>Quit your dilly-dallying and hand them over!<03e0>Do it now!<06e01900>sEVENT_PRICE_QE0820_P_000<08e0000000000000>Fine, fine, geez.<09e008e0010000000300>(I'm not listening.)
...
This...this is it!<03e0>This, finally, is the arrangement of ingredients<03e0>I've sought for so long!
I have tested the results with my own two lips!<03e0>Indeed, good medicine tastes bitter.<04e0>Yes! Yes! With this, even that sweet-mouthed<03e0>beauty in town will swoon over me!<03e0>Aha! Aha! Ahahahahaha!
Whaaat!? Assistant<07f0>are you hiding something from<03e0>me!? How could you?
*sniffle* To think... Such a beautiful woman was really<03e0>a man... It's<07f0>it's unbelievable! Those gams... Gah, it<03e0>should be criminal!<04e0>Not even being chewed up by monsters would be as<03e0>cruel an experience as this... I mean, I<07f003e0>Ergh... Arg!<04e0>...I feel as if I have lost something I can never regain.<03e0>Take your pittance and leave me, boy. I've had enough<03e0>of males for one day.
Last time, the potion I created worked, yet at the same<03e0>time was a terrible, terrible failure.<04e0>Thus, today I begin the creation of a new formula<07f003e0>a new challenge! A new hope!!!<04e0>From this list, I need <1be064f4ecff>25 drops of Blackrose Nectar<1ce0>,<03e01be064f4ecff>15 Shadowood Seeds<1ce0>,<03e0>and <1be064f4ecff>6 handfuls of Cosmosand<1ce0>.<04e0>Yes, these shall be the secret ingredients of my<03e0>newest concoction.
Got it?<03e0>So, be off, my ever-revering assistant #1!
Gahhh! You still haven't gotten ANY of the ingredients<03e0>for my miracle drug? Where's your lust to work, or at<03e0>least get paid?<04e0>From this list, I need <1be064f4ecff>25 drops of Blackrose Nectar<1ce0>,<03e01be064f4ecff>15 Shadowood Seeds<1ce0>,<03e0>and <1be064f4ecff>6 handfuls of Cosmosand<1ce0>.<04e0>That's all you need to find! I don't know how to spell<03e0>it out for you any more than I already have! So get<03e0>going!
Well done, humble assistant! The elixir I've envisioned<03e0>for so long will be completed this time for certain!<03e0>Show me, show me, show me!<04e0>Oooh...look at them, they're marvelous...<03e0>Quit your shilly-shallying and hand them over!<03e0>Do it now!<06e01900>sEVENT_PRICE_QE0820_P_001<08e0000000000000>Alright already, I'm handing.<09e008e0010000000300>(I'm not listening.)
.........
This...this is it!<03e0>This time, I've finally succeeded in creating my ultimate<03e0>elixir!
Not too sweet, not too bitter...less filling, tastes great!<03e0>In fact, for a moment I was captivated by the<03e0>overwhelmingly clear flavor.<04e0>The next-generation elixir the world has been waiting<03e0>for... My super invisibility potion is almost complete!<03e0>Wheee-hee hee hee hee!
What what!? Smirky sneaky assistant #1, are you just<03e0>taunting me? Because that isn't very nice!
Urghhh...<03e0>I thought I'd really become invisible...<04e0>But instead, while I was getting an eyeful, the girls saw<03e0>me, and certainly didn't seem happy about it... It was a<03e0>brutal beatdown!<04e0>I didn't even do anything wrong!<03e0>My motives were completely pure!<03e0>I am a doctor, after all!<04e0>To put it clearly, I have been wounded, both body<03e0>and soul. It is more than I can stand...literally.<04e0>Here, take your money, and begone.<03e0>Just...sometimes, look upon it, and think of me...
Hello, loyal assistant! It has been a long and arduous<03e0>process, but finally the wounds in my heart have<03e0>healed.<04e0>My body as well has returned to its formerly hale<03e0>and hearty state.<04e0>For the first time in some time, I have begun work<03e0>on another miracle potion.<04e0>However, I have finally struck upon the method to<03e0>brew an elixir worthy of being called the ultimate.<04e0>I need <1be064f4ecff>30 drops of Parasitic Oil<1ce0>,<03e01be064f4ecff>18 scoops of Cosmosand<1ce0>, <03e0>and <1be064f4ecff>a single Nightblossom Seed<1ce0>.<04e0>With just these few ingredients, I can create a<03e0>potion that is nothing short of miraculous.
So then! Assistant who may one day be almost as<03e0>fabulous as I #1! I think you know what to do, so go<03e0>do it!
Grahhh!<03e0>A helper like you is no help at all! Is it really that<03e0>amusing to make me wait!?<04e01be064f4ecff>30 drops of Parasitic Oil<1ce0>.<03e01be064f4ecff>18 scoops of Cosmosand<1ce0>.<03e01be064f4ecff>1 Nightblossom Seed<1ce0>.<04e0>How are you unable to understand such a simple<03e0>task? Go go go, and don't come back 'til you're done!
Yes, yes, finally!<03e0>I've been waiting on pins and needles all day!<03e0>Show me<07f0>show meeee!<04e0>Ahhh...look at them, they're splendiferous...<03e0>Quit your<07f0>arg, just hand them over! Do it now!<06e01900>sEVENT_PRICE_QE0820_P_002<08e0000000000000>They're all yours.<09e008e0010000000300>(Enough of this weirdo.)
..............................
Ha ha...hahahAHAHAHAH! This is the zenith! I have<03e0>ascended to empyrean heights! So much so that my<03e0>heart is racing, my blood is boiling!
The simplicity of the components has a certain depth<07f003e0>a rich flavor! It's taken me to a rose-colored world<03e0>I could live in forever!<04e0>The ultimate elixir is within my grasp! And with it, I can<03e0>transform into a female in the flower of youth...!<03e0>Urhurr hurr hurr hurr hurr!!!
Wh-what!? Strangely silent assistant #1...<03e0>After all we've been through, how could you be<03e0>so cold?
*sniffle sniffle* ...What?<03e0>Oh...it worked.<03e0>It was perfect, but for one tragic flaw...<04e0>I mean, if an old man turns into an old woman, what's<03e0>the use in that? *sob*<04e0>What was supposed to be firm and perky was loose<03e0>and flabby... What was supposed to be luscious and<03e0>creamy was dry and wrinkled...<04e0>It was terrible...it was worse than terrible! It was<03e0>perhaps the worst accident to happen in the history<03e0>of man!<04e0>Here, I suppose it's not your fault I am old. Leave<03e0>me... I have seen too many horrors to find any other<03e0>duty for you today.
Oh! Assistant prepared to sacrifice even his life for<03e0>me #1!<04e0>It seems I just don't have it in me to complete my<03e0>ultimate elixir... How disappointing... I wallow in the<03e0>depths of despair.<04e0>Thus, I have decided to take a trip around the world,<03e0>to expand my horizons and increase my repertoire.<03e0>In short, you're fired.<04e0>This will be my final gift to you.<03e0>It's a rather unwanted byproduct of my previous<03e0>trials... A failure.<04e0>I meant to get rid of it with everything else, but I<03e0>have been too busy. So, as my former assistant,<03e0>I leave its disposal in your hands.<04e0>Alright, that's all I had to say. If ever our paths<03e0>cross again, we may share a meal. Be sure to<03e0>bring an attractive companion.<04e0>Farewell!
*weep*...*sob*

A bunch of bugs have spawned in the <1be0ffbe34ff>Salamander's Tail<1ce003e0>area of the <1be0ffbe34ff>Great Sand Sea<1ce0>. It would really help me<03e0>out if you went out there and destroyed the hive.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Extermination, I can do.<09e008e0010000000300>I'm insectophobic.

You got my sister back!<03e0>I really owe you, mister!

My name is Raphus. I'm an adventurer who has<03e0>traveled the world over.
At least...I did, 50 years ago. Heh heh!
Now, it seems the hip new thing for adventurers<03e0>to do is trade treasures. I was certain that if I<03e0>did it too, I could make a pretty penny!<04e0>Problem is... Well, I got a little carried away,<03e0>and traded away my biggest treasure...<03e0>All for a measly bottle of Royotian wine.<04e0>Son, could you help an old man out and get<03e0>back my treasure? That's all I really want...<03e0>Anything else you get trading is yours to keep.<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'll give it a whirl.<09e008e0010000000300>Your stuff is long gone.

Oh... Oh dear...

But then, I do<03e0>a lot of traveling...used to, anyway!<04e0>Would you help me get my precious treasure<03e0>back?

O-oh... Hrmm.

Ohhh!<03e0>That map!
Hmm hmm!<03e0>It was a good idea to ask this of you after all!<04e0>Long ago, when my dear wife and I had adventures<03e0>of our own, we used this map to find our way.<04e0>The memories at just seeing this paper...<03e0>Priceless, son, priceless.<04e0>But get this<07f0>some folks see it and think our<03e0>scribbles are some sort of ancient map or<03e0>something, imagine that!

Yeah, it's possible that if you give back the<03e0>scabbard, you might get back the old man's treasure...<04e0>Alright.

Sorry, it seems you're a bit...short.
Then, you will not get the Ring. I believe I told<03e0>you I'd had my fill of this barter system.
A treasure map?
You mean, that false map to the Imperator's<03e0>treasure? It was nothing but a child's doodle.<04e0>Beauson, that bastard... He knowingly traded<03e0>me that piece of garbage<07f0>he'll pay for that!
Where is the map now?
I don't know about you, child, but I throw<03e0>garbage away.<04e0>It's probably fallen around here somewhere.
Oh? He returned the Irised Stone?<04e0>Mmm... You can keep it. I received it in a<03e0>trade myself. I really have no need of it.<04e0>While you're at it, take this Ring of Morning<03e0>Calm. I sold it to you, and yet somehow it's<03e0>come back into my possession.
Do you need something?
So, a "Rainn" requested this?<03e0>Curious...

I am Beauson.
Hmph. You wish to reverse the trade of that<03e0>Ancient Scabbard?<04e0>Fine. I will take back my scabbard, and in<03e0>return, give you information on what I traded it for.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Fine, whatever.<09e008e0010000000300>Info? Don't make me laugh.
It was a map...though I doubt it's what the<03e0>woman I traded it to thinks it is. She believes<03e0>it leads to the treasure of the Imperator.
Hmph, fine, I do not need the scabbard. I'll<03e0>give you the information for a flask of wine.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Like, say...Royotian wine?<09e008e0010000000300>No. Show me the treasure.
It was a map...though I doubt it's what the<03e0>woman I traded it to thinks it is. She believes<03e0>it leads to the treasure of the Imperator.
Ghkk... I don't have it anymore, alright? Now,<03e0>do you want to hear where it is or not? Even<03e0>some Royotian Ore will do, so hand it over.<06e01900>sEVENT_PRICE_QE1020_P_040<08e0000000000000>Royotian Ore, then?<09e008e0010000000300>Look, just forget it.
It was a map...though I doubt it's what the<03e0>woman I traded it to thinks it is. She believes<03e0>it leads to the treasure of the Imperator.
Then, I shan't tell you a thing.
No, no, no, I had no intention to deceive...<04e0>Goodness, if it's got you both in such a tizzy,<03e0>then I'll return what I traded her, alright?<04e0>Here, the Irised Stone.
Alyssa has quite the number of precious items<03e0>for trade, hasn't she? Curious, don't you think?
Yes? You look as though you've something to<03e0>tell me.

You know Balterossa, right? It's the trade city<03e0>in the middle of the Great Sand Sea.<04e0>It's an important hub on the way from the<03e0>mining city of Royotia. Pretty much all goods<03e0>going from Royotia pass through Balterossa.<04e0>From there, they go on to Elysion,<03e0>then all over the continent.<04e0>After all that, by the time they make it all<03e0>the way here to Athlum, goods from Royotia<03e0>have a pretty heavy markup.
So, we've started talks for making a trade route from<03e0>Balterossa straight to Athlum. We even hired a guy to<03e0>map out the exact route.<04e0>But the surveyor's giving us a little trouble... You know<03e0>the Jhana, right? Annoying, but no big deal? Well, they<03e0>are to him.<04e0>He says he's not going in there without a bodyguard.<03e0>So, if you're looking to pick up a little pocket change...<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, sounds interesting.<09e008e0010000000300>Sorry, don't care!
Alright. Head to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Gaslin Caves<1ce0>. If you enter<03e0>and take the first path on your right, you'll see<03e0>the proposed route to the Great Sand Sea.<04e0>You've just gotta protect the surveyor from the<03e0>Jhana, okay?
Bah, whatever! Not like you're not gonna take<03e0>advantage of the lower prices once they make<03e0>the route, huh? Damned kids.
You're back. So, you gonna help out with the trade<03e0>route survey?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, I'll help out.<09e008e0010000000300>Sorry, still don't care!
So! Seems like the surveyor made it safely to<03e0>Balterossa.<04e0>We can finally make the dream of direct trade with<03e0>Balterossa a reality. Thanks for all your help.
Hey, kid. You forget the bit about how you were helping<03e0>out with that survey of the <1be0ffbe34ff>Gaslin Caves<1ce0>? 'Cause I sure<03e0>didn't.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah, yeah, I'm going!<09e008e0010000000300>I'm, uh, making preparations.
Better be. Now, enter the caves and it'll be the first<03e0>path on your right.<04e0>You've just gotta protect the surveyor from the Jhana,<03e0>okay?
Well, make 'em faster, huh? There's a lot riding on this<03e0>survey getting finished!

Thank you for coming. Rush, is it?<03e0>Now that you're here, we can start the survey.<04e0>I don't need you to do anything special! I'll<03e0>make certain this route will take us to the exit,<03e0>and you make sure we get there in one piece.<04e0>If we run into any Jhana, I'm no use to anyone.<03e0>So just tell me what to do, alright? I leave<03e0>myself in your hopefully capable hands.
I've got a bad feeling about this...<03e0>It looks like there's something up ahead!<03e0>What should we do?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Wait, I'll check it out.<09e008e0010000000000>Go on, I got you covered.
Ahh... Guess I'm just a little jumpy.<03e0>Better safe than sorry, I always say!
Gyaaaah!!!
There's a fork in the path...<03e0>Which way should we go?<03e0>I swear there's Jhana to the right...<06e0000008e0000000000000>Let's head right.<09e008e0010000000000>Let's head left.
Huh, I guess it's on patrol.<03e0>Lucky us!
Aughhh!!!
Wait, stop. I got chills all down my back...<03e0>There's something up ahead, I know it. What do we do?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Wait, I'll take care of it.<09e008e0010000000000>Go on, I got your back.
Phew... Looks like the coast is clear.
Graaaugh!!!
There are totally Jhana around here!<03e0>But I'm pretty sure the left leads to a dead end...<03e0>Where should we go?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Let's head right.<09e008e0010000000000>Let's head left.
Geh<07f0>nooooo!!
Phew, we slipped past them.<03e0>Good thing we went this way!
Looks like they're setting up an ambush!<03e0>What do we do?<03e0>I mean, I only see one of them...<06e0000008e0000000000000>Let's take 'em on!<09e008e0010000000000>Let's wait and see.
Oho! What a wimp! Once it saw us<07f0>er,<03e0>specifically, you<07f0>it ran with its tail between<03e0>its legs!
Geh<07f0>nooooo!!
The exit should be just ahead, but instead of feeling<03e0>better, I've got a horrible feeling that something<03e0>super-creepy is lurking just around the next corner...!<06e0000008e0000000000000>Wait, I'll take care of it.<09e008e0010000000000>Go on, I got your back.
Geh<07f0>nooooo!!
Oh! Ahahah, guess it was nothing. Who knew?
Thank you, thanks a lot! We were right<07f0>this path did<03e0>come all the way through to the Great Sand Sea!

I'll go straight to Balterossa from here. You've really<03e0>helped this time<07f0>this survey was a success.<04e0>Here, for you.
The Great Sand Sea is an integral part of the world's<03e0>commerce. Cross the desert, and even you can find<03e0>some great new things.<04e0>Later!

That's what I like to hear.<03e0>I knew I saw a real man in ya!
Right. So, finish up your business, and meet me<03e0>at the <1be0ffbe34ff>Gaslin Caves<1ce0>. I'll tell you the details there.
Guess I read you wrong, huh?<03e0>I'll ask around an' find someone else.<03e0>Sorry for takin' your time.
Hmm?<03e0>Changed your mind about the job, did you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, I'm up for it.<09e008e0010000000300>Still not interested.
I still haven't been able to find the poor lost little<03e0>lad. Not to drop too strong a hint, but I sure<03e0>could use another pair of eyes for the search.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Hey, I'll help out.<09e008e0010000000300>Yeah...good luck with that.
Hmm?<03e0>Changed your mind about the job, did you?
Nice work back there, pal.<03e0>I couldn't have done it without your help.<04e0>The kid's pa was quite thankful as well.<03e0>Gave me twice the reward, he did.<03e0>Here, here's your half.
Didn't expect all this...<03e0>I can get her something real nice...
Hmm?<03e0>Nothing, nothing, just thinkin' out loud.<04e0>Say, if you ever need a partner in a fight,<03e0>pop by the guild and let me know.<04e0>We're mates now, so anytime you need a hand!

Oho, finally made it.<03e0>Right then, so here's what this's all about.<04e0>The son of a certain aristocrat<07f0>our employer,<03e0>by the way<07f0>went out to play here in the caves.<03e0>Problem is, he never came back.<04e0>Dependin' on the time of day, these caves fill up with<03e0>monsters. It's likely the kid just got trapped tryin' to hide<03e0>from 'em. Either way, our job is to find that kid.<04e0>What, you wanted somethin' more exciting? Believe it or<03e0>not, there's more to this than playing nursemaid.<04e0>The kid is just a wee little thing, and a bit of a weakling<03e0>at that. His folks are right worried about 'im.<04e0>What's more, a downright nasty bunch of bandits are<03e0>rumored to have their hideout in the caves. If we don't<03e0>find the kid before they do...<04e0>Well, let's just make sure that doesn't happen, savvy?<03e0>Let's be off, then.
WAHHHHHHHHHH!!!<03e0>Lemme alone, lemme alone!<03e0>I wanna go home, helllp!!!
Urgh... Quiet, you!
That voice... Bloody<07f003e0>C'mon, Rush, we better hurry!
HELLLLLLLLLP!!!
Hey<07f0> Ow! Watch it!<03e0>Quit struggling and sit there like a good victim!
B-bro! Come on, give it up!<03e0>We're supposed to be kidnapping<07f0>this's<03e0>more like giantnapping!
Yeah, yeah! He can squish us without even<03e0>trying! How're we supposed to ransom him<03e0>when we're flat as pancakes?
Ghk<07f0>shut up, both of ya!<04e0>Blurg... They said some sick, wimpy little rich<03e0>kid was lost in the cave<07f0>how was I s'posed<03e0>to know he'd be some giant yama doof?
Looks like trouble.<04e0>Rush, we gotta save him!<03e006e0000008e0000000000000>Uhhh, okay.<09e008e0010000000000>Uhhh, which "him"?
Which one do you think?<03e0>The kid, o' course!<03e006e0000008e0000000000000>Alright, if you say so...<09e008e0010000000000>Looks pretty safe to me.
Awright!<03e0>Let's give these guys what they deserve!
What's this tripe you're going on about?<03e0>Let's bust some heads!
Th-thank you, misters!<03e0>I<07f0>I was real scared!
Don't worry, lad, you're alright now.
Rush, I'm gonna take this little one back home.<03e0>Meet me in the Athlum pub, and I'll have your<03e0>part of the reward, fair enough?
See you 'round the bend, then.

Wow, he's really late. Where did he go...?
Oh, hello there. Sorry, I'm a little out of it...<04e0>You see, it's almost the anniversary of my sister's<03e0>death... Every year, I like to bring flowers to her grave<03e0>to mark the occasion.<04e0>But those flowers, <1be064f4ecff>animaquies<1ce0>, only grow in the<03e0>farthest depths of <1be0ffbe34ff>Darken Forest<1ce0>.<04e0>I'm not very strong and barely can get through the forest<03e0>alive. But a few years ago, this guy offered to pick them<03e0>for me, and he's been doing me the favor ever since.<04e0>It's taking him an awfully long time to come back with<03e0>the flowers this year, though. I'm getting worried that<03e0>something happened. I'm running out of time...<04e0>We've just met, but can I ask you a favor?<03e0>Can you find him for me?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, I've got some time.<09e008e0010000000300>Just go buy her a bouquet.
You'll go? Thank you!<03e0>I'm Rhagoh, by the way.
What are you, some kind of idiot!?
I hope that guy is okay. <1be0ffbe34ff>Darken Forest<1ce0> is a really<03e0>dangerous place. But I really need those flowers...<04e0>I don't have a good feeling about this.<03e0>Please find him.
I'm running out of time... I sent someone to bring me<03e0>flowers for my sister's grave, but he's still not back...<03e0>Can you go to <1be0ffbe34ff>Darken Forest<1ce0> and see if he's okay?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure, I've got some time.<09e008e0010000000300>Go pick the flowers over there.
You'll go? Thank you!<03e0>I'm Rhagoh, by the way.
What are you, some type of idiot!? <1be064f4ecff>Animaquies<1ce0> put the<03e0>souls of the dead to rest. No other flower can do that.<04e0>If you don't have any idea what you're talking about,<03e0>then just keep your fat mouth shut!
You got them!<03e0>Rush, thank you so much!<03e0>Just in time, too.<04e0>So did you find...?<04e0>...<03e0>Oh, I see...<03e0>He was attacked by a monster...<04e0>I actually didn't know him very well. I never knew why<03e0>he was willing to bring me those flowers from such a<03e0>dangerous place.<04e0>I wish I had gotten to know him better.<03e0>He seemed like a good man.<04e0>Well, I should be off.<03e0>I should visit her grave before the day...
What!?<03e0>You saw a woman who fits Kate's description<03e0>in the depths of Darken Forest?<04e0>That's ridiculous...<03e0>How is that possible?<04e0>Thank you for the tip.<03e0>I'll look into it right away.<04e0>Come around to the guild if you ever need<03e0>some help. I'm not the best fighter, but I'll do<03e0>whatever I can.<04e0>Goodbye!
There was no one in <1be0ffbe34ff>Darken Forest<1ce0>?<03e0>Hmmm...<04e0>I don't want to seem pushy, but will<03e0>you go back there again? I know there's<03e0>something going on there...<06e0000008e0000000000000>Alright, alright.<09e008e0010000000300>Again? No thanks.
Thank you! I knew you would help<03e0>me out.
I don't have time to play games!

Ohhh...
I must ask a favor of you.<03e0>I've not much time...<04e0>These flowers are for a young fellow in Celapaleis<03e0>named Rhagoh. Take them to him...please...
...<04e0>My brother sent you, didn't he?<04e0>Go back and tell him to forget about me.

I hope my choice does not cause him<03e0>  and his sister further suffering...<04e0>(The words are faded and cannot be made out.)

I'll do it.<09e008e0010000000300>Or what. ...That means no.

Greetings, traveler.<03e0>What brings you to our humble town?<04e0>...<03e0>You wish to know about Melphina's holy chalice,<03e0>you say?<04e0>...It is true that this town has kept a holy chalice for<03e0>centuries. Your interest is appreciated, but...what do<03e0>you want with this information?<04e0>The chalice cannot be taken out of town, much<03e0>less handed to a stranger. If that is what you have<03e0>come here for, then I am afraid we cannot help you.
What?<03e0>You came from Elysion?<04e0>Then maybe you've seen a qsiti by<03e0>the name of Darien?<04e0>I'm sorry, it's a big city.<03e0>It'd be too much of a coincidence if you<03e0>did know him.<04e0>He left town out of guilt after an incident,<03e0>but everyone's forgiven him by now.<03e0>Yet he still doesn't return...<04e0>Even the daughter of that shopkeeper has forgiven<03e0>him. *sigh* What a stubborn young man...
I have no idea why Darien won't return to this town.<04e0>Even the daughter of that shopkeeper has forgiven<03e0>him. *sigh* What a stubborn young man...
My grandson Bino has told me everything. Darien was<03e0>the one who put you up to coming here, correct?<04e0>I see.<03e0>I understand what's going on...<04e0>...<04e0>Fine.<03e0>The chalice is yours.<03e0>Make certain it gets to Darien.
And give him a message for me.<04e0>...Or is that even necessary? The chalice may be<03e0>enough of a message.<04e0>Never before has the chalice been left in the hands<03e0>of a stranger.<04e0>He must know what it means for me to be doing this.<03e0>Be safe on your journey back to Elysion.
Make sure the holy chalice gets back to Darien.
Huh? Darien?<04e0>I told him I'd forgive him, but to be honest, I'm not<03e0>sure I can.<03e0>It's all his fault that that poor girl...<04e0>Ah, I'm sorry. I don't mean to rant to a complete<03e0>stranger.<04e0>But whenever I see Goster, I know he's still in pain...
I remember that day as if it were yesterday.<04e0>I'd never seen Goster so angry, nor Darien so<03e0>crestfallen.<04e0>In the end, I think Darien left because of Goster.<03e0>Now that it's all over, I wonder how he feels about it?
Darien is in Elysion now?<04e0>I wonder if he's ever going to come back.<03e0>Though even if he did, I have no idea<03e0>what I would say to him.
Hello and welcome to Melphina.<03e0>This here is the place to shop!
What do ya want?<03e0>You have questions about Darien?<04e0>What are ya, his spy or somethin'?<03e0>Get outta here!<03e0>I got nothing to say to you!
Was that so hard to understand?<03e0>Buzz off!<03e0>I ain't talking to ya!<04e0>I'm on my break. If the old lady sees you,<03e0>I got no idea what she'll do.<03e0>Leave. Now.
You're still here!?<03e0>Are you freakin' stupid?<03e0>Lemme take my break in peace!
There you are, HONEY!!!
Ack!<03e0>Wh-what are you doing here!?
It was you, wasn't it!?<03e0>You ratted me out!<03e0>Get ready to pay for...
Shut your mouth!
Y-yes, dear!
Not only do I catch you slacking off, but you're about<03e0>to place the blame on someone else for your laziness!?<04e0>You'd better get back to work before I get really mad...<03e0>Do you hear me!?
Y-yes, loud and clear...
I'm so sorry you had to see that.<04e0>Oh yes, it seemed like you had a question for my<03e0>husband? Go right ahead, he'll answer anything you<03e0>want. ...Right, sweetie?<04e0>Well, my job here is done. Ta-ta for now~
I-I didn't think I'd get out of that alive...<04e0>Dammit, I gotta get back to work and now I'm stuck<03e0>answering your dumb questions!?<04e0>Fine, ask away. You want to know what happened<03e0>with me and Darien, then? ...Guess I might as well tell<03e0>you.<04e0>He... Darien...<03e0>He killed my little sister.<04e0>I won't forgive him. I got no reason to. But I can't stand<03e0>the thought of him dyin' in the gutter without payin' for<03e0>what he did to her, either...<04e0>I been waitin' and waitin' for him to come back,<03e0>but it doesn't look like he is.<04e0>That all you needed to know?<04e0>If you wanna know more about Darien, ask Bino.<03e0>They were real close.<04e0>I really gotta go now.<03e0>See yas.
Nothin' beats a break from the grind.
Well, hello there. You're not from around here, are you?<03e0>Are you lost?<04e0>What? You want to know about Darien?<04e0>Well... I know that he used to live here, but not much<03e0>else. Sorry, I haven't lived here for that long myself.<04e0>My husband was born in this town.<03e0>Maybe he can answer whatever questions you have.<03e0>...Goodness, where is he!?<04e0>He's supposed to be working, but I don't see him...<03e0>Ooh, that man is asking for it!
What? You met him by the town entrance?<04e0>Well, well.<03e0>So that's where he decided to skip off to today...<04e0>Excuse me, but I must be off.<03e0>Someone needs to be taught a lesson!
Oh, hello.<03e0>Did you get the answers you needed?<04e0>It's funny. My husband's never mentioned a Darien<03e0>to me before. I wonder why that is?
...
He's finally gone back to work.<03e0>He's like this every day!<04e0>I'm sorry if he was rude to you.<03e0>Tell this Darien fellow I said hi!
Where is he!?<03e0>Where has he gone off to now!?<03e0>Must I go and find him every day!?
Hi, mister.<03e0>What? Yeah, I'm Bino. That's me.<04e0>You want to know about Darien?<03e0>Hmm, where do I start?<03e0>He's a simple guy but really sensitive.<04e0>He used to live here, but not anymore.<03e0>I don't know where he is now.<04e0>Huh? You heard that he killed someone and<03e0>got run out of town?<04e0>Haha! That's a great story.<03e0>You can't tell, but Darien's a really nice guy.<03e0>He couldn't kill anyone.<04e0>There was this one incident, though...<03e0>Darien left shortly afterwards.<04e0>Why are you so interested in him?<04e0>What!? You met him?<03e0>And he asked you to bring him the holy chalice?<04e0>Oh, I get it. He's still...<04e0>Alright.<03e0>My grandpa's in charge of guarding the chalice.<04e0>You can find him around the town entrance.<03e0>Good luck!
Cool!<03e0>Grandpa lent you the chalice, huh?<04e0>Tell Darien I say hi and that I hope he comes back<03e0>soon.
What a nice day!<03e0>The Blue Elf looks clearer than ever.
I've been feeling slightly sick since<03e0>the Blue Elf has been gone...

You have met many people on your<03e0>journey who have helped you grow.<04e0>In return, you have given them something<03e0>very valuable. Something they will treasure<03e0>for always.<04e0>It is hard to describe in words what<03e0>exactly you have bestowed upon others...

The Jhana have grown too large in number. We of the<03e0>Silver Falcons will go to <1be0ffbe34ff>Blackdale<1ce0>, lure them into battle,<03e0>and crush them.<04e0>Will you lend a hand?<06e0000008e0000000000000>'Course!<09e008e0010000000000>Sounds dull.
I would like to proceed to <1be0ffbe34ff>Blackdale<1ce0> as soon as possible.<03e0>Are you prepared?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup!<09e008e0010000000300>I need two secs...
Glory to the Falcons!
If you have other pending matters, so be it.
Of all beings that deserve mercy, the Jhana are<03e0>not among their number.
Well done.<03e0>They will behave themselves...for now.<04e0>Fear is not an emotion they sustain<03e0>for long periods of time.
Here, take this.
I may ask you for assistance again<03e0>in the future.<03e0>Until then.

There's been sighting of a Jhana clan in the vicinity<03e0>of the <1be0ffbe34ff>Nest of Eagles<1ce0>.<04e0>Will you lend a hand again?<06e0000008e0000000000000>'Course!<09e008e0010000000000>Just let 'em be.

Glory to the Falcons!
If you have other pending matters,<03e0>so be it.
I believe I've said this before, but<03e0>they do not deserve your mercy.
Excellent job.<03e0>They will return, but hopefully not for a very long time.
It's astonishing how little concern the Lords pay to<03e0>problems outside of their own borders.<04e0>They seem to have no interest in getting involved with<03e0>issues that concern the whole world. Or, perhaps, they<03e0>are fettered by national interests and cannot act freely...
Either way, that is why we exist.
Here, take this.
I may ask you for your assistance<03e0>again in the future. Although I hope<03e0>all stays peaceful.

Soldiers of the Conqueror's army were spotted near<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Undelwalt<1ce0>.<04e0>I know not their intentions, but they must be dealt<03e0>with without delay. You of all people should understand.<04e0>The Silver Falcons will engage the Conqueror's army<03e0>at <1be0ffbe34ff>Harphlus Pass<1ce0>. I hope you will accompany us.<06e0000008e0000000000000>Don't gotta ask me twice!<09e008e0010000000000>Let's leave them alone.

If you have other pending matters,<03e0>so be it. There is a chance the situation<03e0>may change if we leave it be for now.
This group is the cause of the world's current chaos.<03e0>These beings are sentient... They are more of a threat<03e0>then any Jhana could ever be.
The Falcons know only the meaning of victory.<03e0>However, today's results are in large part due to your<03e0>help.<04e0>Take this.
From now on, the Falcons will no longer request your<03e0>assistance... It feels odd, being so truly indebted to<03e0>someone.
The Silver Falcons fight for justice regardless of<03e0>whose land we are on. We have made enemies of<03e0>several Lords, but we do not fight for their recognition.<04e0>However, you have been a strong and true ally, and<03e0>I promise to repay that debt. We shall fight with you,<03e0>whatever the reason.<04e0>Go to the guild facing Elysion's Assembly Hall if you<03e0>ever have need of our assistance.

Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis asked me to find<03e0>his wife, Violet. Something tells me they're not<03e0>the most loving couple in the world...
Found Violet in the Ivory Peaks, and brought<03e0>her back to the Baron. They don't talk much.<03e0>Is this what marriage is about?
I guess Violet left the Ivory Peaks and returned<03e0>to her husband.
Baron Nielsen asked me to find his wife<03e0>again<07f0>this time at the Gaslin Caves.<03e0>...If marriage is this hard, I ain't doin' it!
Violet almost killed Duke Qubine today...<03e0>Instead he made her a heroine, and now the<03e0>Gilles-Barre name is carved in history. Huh.
Paris wants me to go with him to meet his love<03e0>in the bell tower of Mojcado Castle.<03e0>I wonder where my true love is.
Someone was out to kill Paris, but we averted<03e0>the crisis and now Charlotte is back in his arms.<03e0>Good for them!
Paris hired me as a bodyguard again. I was about<03e0>to meet with him and Charlotte in the Great<03e0>Subterrane, when Charlotte was kidnapped!
We saved Charlotte, but she ended up dumping<03e0>Paris because it was upsetting her mom.<03e0>Seriously? I think it's time to leave the nest.
Balterossa and Royotia are at each other's throats.<03e0>Charlotte asked me to go with her to Royotia.<03e0>Who can say no to such a cute gal?
I went to Royotia but couldn't find Charlotte.<03e0>Too bad... I really enjoy her company.
Phew! Balterossa and Royotia made nice.<03e0>Charlotte and Paris got back together, but<03e0>they both have a lot on their plates, looks like.
Roberto of Melphina asked me to go to Crookfen<03e0>to check out the Last Leaf's seal. It broke or<03e0>something and monsters are everywhere.
Thanks to Forest Maiden Marsha, the seal<03e0>is all good. Woot! No more monsters<03e0>in that area now!
There was trouble in Crookfen, but it looks<03e0>like Roberto led the Knights of Melphina and<03e0>saved the Last Leaf without my help.
A bunch of Melphinian knights vanished,<03e0>so we headed to Siebenbur after Leticia<03e0>used her second sight to find us a clue.
We found the knights, but some idiot broke<03e0>the bridge we crossed, so we have to find<03e0>another way to get outta here.
We got rid of the danger here! We rock!<03e0>Time to head back to Melphina!
The knights were rescued from Siebenbur<03e0>and everyone went back to Melphina.<03e0>Still don't know who destroyed the bridge...
Looks like Roberto led the Order of Melphina<03e0>and saved his men without my help.<03e0>Brave guy.
Melphina was attacked by a buttload of<03e0>monsters, but we took care of 'em.<03e0>We saved the seal!
Melphina was attacked by a buttload of<03e0>monsters but we took care of 'em.<03e0>Marsha sealed the Remnant again with her prayers.
People are worried that something happened<03e0>to the Cosmos Maiden in Crookfen.
Found Sheryl, the Cosmos Maiden, in Crookfen.<03e0>I think she's a few stars short of a galaxy...
I got Sheryl safely to Nagapur.<03e0>Kosmosfest is about to start.<03e0>Fun times ahead!
Kosmosfest just started, but there are a bunch<03e0>of monsters in the area and the Maiden can't<03e0>concentrate. Time to take some action!
The Kosmosfest was a huge success.<03e0>The Syltique taught us that the world<03e0>wasn't created so we could fight each other.
Going to Dillmoor as Glenys's bodyguard.<03e0>We have the key to some underground area<03e0>that's supposed to be around there.
I found the entrance to the underground<03e0>area we're looking for! Aces!<03e0>Now we just need to get to the bottom floor.
We got to the bottom floor of Aveclyff, but<03e0>I don't see anybody. Glenys wants me to<03e0>pay attention to any weirdness around us.
The person we were looking for turned into a<03e0>monster, so we slew him and got a formation<03e0>scroll. Score! Glenys disappeared soon after that.
Glenys asked me for some help, but she<03e0>ended up going on her journey alone.<03e0>No one's seen her since.
Glenys wants us to find the Spear of Origin.<03e0>Some shady guy in Undelwalt is selling old<03e0>treasures, so I should try talking to him.
Got the scroll Snakebite from a real shady<03e0>vendor in the guild.
Got a shard formula from a real shady<03e0>vendor in Gefyri.
Got a Finsternis from a real shady vendor<03e0>in the pub.
The Spear of Origin was returned to Glenys's<03e0>hometown. Even though the town doesn't exist<03e0>anymore, its honor lives on.
Some guy in Balterossa asked me to take three<03e0>godstones to the altar of the desert tower.<03e0>Ugh, that's way out in the Great Sand Sea...
Finally reached Flaumello Tower! Time to plop<03e0>down those three rocks on the altar.<03e0>The tower is so full of history. Exciting stuff!
All three stones were offered.<03e0>I wonder what's going to happen...
We beat the Mantroskylo forces and saved<03e0>Queen Flaumello's soul. Guess this finally<03e0>is the end of the Kingdom of Glenys.
Yuniver wants me to investigate some mystic<03e0>something. It was too confusing to understand.<03e0>All I know is that it's dangerous.
Found some mystic circle thing, but it just<03e0>disappeared along with some weird gibberish.<03e0>I wonder what it was trying to point us to...
Yuniver's investigation is over. We didn't figure<03e0>everything out, but apparently, if we kept investigating<03e0>it, the world would lose its balance or something.
We beat the Fallen, some kickass monster<03e0>Wyngale was chained to. Now he's free, and<03e0>grinning like a fool. It's...actually kinda creepy...
Jorgen lost his memory, but I might be able<03e0>to help him get it back by showing him things<03e0>connected to his past.
Jorgen regained his memory.<03e0>He says he's gonna treasure it from<03e0>now on.
Loki wants me to go with him to Mt. Vackel.<03e0>We need to get some visuminsumos so<03e0>a girl he likes can get her sight back.
Reya can see now, thanks to the visuminsumos!<03e0>Loki thought his ugliness would scare her away,<03e0>but it looks like they're closer than ever.
Rhagoh from Celapaleis asked me to help<03e0>him find the goddess statue in the Robelia<03e0>Ruins so he can see his sister again.
The Remnant Collapsed and Kate came out of<03e0>nowhere. I guess she wasn't so dead after all...
Rhagoh never found the statue and<03e0>his dreams of living with his sister<03e0>were shattered.
The customization guy in Celapaleis wants me<03e0>to get him some ore while I carry around<03e0>this ugly little creature.
Found some ore! Made the customization guy<03e0>real happy. The ugly little creature likes me and<03e0>decided to stay with me and help me out.
This flamboyant white sovani wants me to<03e0>get him some white flower seeds. He says<03e0>the monsters in the Catacombs have 'em.
Got some seeds!<03e0>The white sovani seemed happy.<03e0>I still think he coulda just taken a shower.
The white sovani asked me to help him<03e0>out, but it looks like he found his own<03e0>way of cleaning himself up.
This freaky, huge white yama lost his six<03e0>treasures, and wants me to find them. They're<03e0>somewhere around the other Blackdale entrance.
The white yama went psycho on me!<03e0>He didn't even want his stuff!<03e0>And I went through all that trouble...
I was looking for the white yama's treasures,<03e0>but he wandered off somewhere without saying<03e0>anything. Guess he didn't need them after all.
A white qsiti wants me to get him the Forbidden<03e0>Tome that's been sealed for hundreds of years.<03e0>Apparently, it's in the Catacombs somewhere.
The Forbidden Tome had rotted, but I showed<03e0>the qsiti the picture of his ex-comrades and<03e0>he freaked out! I wonder where he's headed now.
I was gonna help out the white qsiti,<03e0>but I guess I was too late.<03e0>He was long gone.
This cute black-haired girl in Balterossa wants<03e0>me to get her sister, who's in Mojcado Castle<03e0>looking for something she lost.
I found Hinnah cowering from some huge bugs.<03e0>I tried to get her to leave, but she won't budge<03e0>without finding the item she lost.
Hinnah found her earring, so I took her back to her sis.<03e0>Sadly, they left afterwards, but Hannah promised a "hotter,<03e0>more intense" meeting next time...I can't wait!
I was gonna help the cute black-haired girl<03e0>find her sister, but I guess I was too late...
This shady guy came up to me and dared me to get<03e0>a Bloodsoaked Blade from a Grand Beetle in the<03e0>Great Sand Sea. Piece of cake!
It looks like I lost the dare... But the guy gave<03e0>a raincheck on that killing me stuff. Weird guy...<03e0>Says he'll see me later<07f0>not if I see him first!
The shady guy isn't in Baaluk anymore.<03e0>Does that mean I lost the dare? Oh man, he's<03e0>not really gonna try to kill me, right?
Some old guy ran off to Lavafender after a<03e0>monster that turned into a sword. He's<03e0>obviously senile. Guess I should save him...
Seems bandits are after the old dude.<03e0>What were they talking about, anyway?<03e0>What "psycho old man"?
The old dude left in pursuit of the sword.<03e0>The girl who sent me after him seemed relieved.<03e0>I wonder who he was. No one seems to know.
The old man who believed in the legend<03e0>apparently got a hold of it.<03e0>Good for him!
The Third Committee made Leithion's Sword,<03e0>a weapon that can trigger Collapses, or something.<03e0>I gotta help Duke Ghor find that sword!
Thanks to Leithion's Sword doing its Collapse thing,<03e0>there're funky rifts in space everywhere. It's gonna be<03e0>hell trying to track it down...
Duke Ghor destroyed the sword. Ha!<03e0>And he even said he's gonna help me out<03e0>if I ever need it. Aces!
Emma wants help destroying a giant in Robelia<03e0>Ruins. Seems like someone's set it up especially<03e0>so that it'll take out Athlumian soldiers...
We totally took out the giant. Too easy!<03e0>Afterwards, Emma headed to the Valeria Heart.<03e0>It looks like she's waiting for someone.
I promised to help destroy the giant in<03e0>the Robelia Ruins, but it looks like<03e0>the Athlum army already took care of it.
This Allan guy wants help destroying the Steel<03e0>Syndicate. We have to catch them in the Gaslin<03e0>Caves before they make it to Athlum!
Torgal and Allan are bummed that some people<03e0>believe violence is good. Allan left to<03e0>continue his journey for truth.
Blocter asked me to join him in the Tournament<03e0>of Heroes at the Heroic Ramparts.<03e0>We breezed through to the second round.
The second round was a joke!<03e0>Now it's time for the finals, baby!
Me and Blocter totally kicked ass!<03e0>We brought the title of Hero Exemplar home to Athlum.<03e0>Pfft, like there was any doubt!
Pagus's old friend Sibal says he caught a glimpse<03e0>of the Remnant of Miracles, the Arco Iris.<03e0>I gotta go to Royotia and talk to him.
The Remnant of Miracles, the Arco Iris,<03e0>was spotted in Siebenbur, but that place is<03e0>crawling with monsters...
Me and Pagus's friends Maddox and Sibal beat<03e0>the monsters in Siebenbur. Yes!<03e0>The Arco Iris was in their hearts... What...?
Someone challenged Emmy to a duel.<03e0>Apparently, this is something she HAS to do.<03e0>The opponent, warrior Yerva, is waiting in Aveclyff.
Gazing at the Valeria Heart's shadow, Emmy<03e0>swore to protect Athlum under the name of<03e0>Emma Honeywell. Just like her mom.
David wants me to go with him to Fornstrand.<03e0>He says he's meeting someone, but I've never<03e0>heard him mention a friend living there before.
David fulfilled his promise to his friend.<03e0>I'm glad he finally got a chance to finish<03e0>up something he's been meaning to do for a long time.
In the Celapaleis tavern, Haruko asked me to help her<03e0>find the Dead Heart, a legendary Remnant with the power<03e0>to grant wishes. Sounds like a useful trick!
I helped out Haruko and got the Dead Heart.<03e0>Her next goal is to see what we can do in order<03e0>for people and Remnants to coexist.
I went looking for the Dead Heart like Haruko<03e0>asked, but we couldn't find it. What a bummer!<03e0>Haruko ran off, looking for more Remnants, I guess.
So, to grab Blank Remnants like the Chairman says<03e0>we have to, we're gonna need some tablet thing.<03e0>Luckily, Mom says there's one in Marshallton.
I kicked the combined asses of Namul Sin and<03e0>Niram Sin and got myself a tablet. Haha!<03e0>Now I can get my hands on lots of cool Remnants!
Jager wants me to help him find the Lob Omen.<03e0>It's been spotted near Wyrmskeep, so I should<03e0>head over to the Aqueducts and make my way inside.
I found the Lob Omen in Wyrmskeep and boy,<03e0>it looked pissed! I almost had it but it just<03e0>barely got away. Dammit! I guess I'll have to keep looking.
I got the Lob Omen back. As if there was<03e0>any doubt that I could!<03e0>Jager's happy. All's good.
Nordis and Azelle have been tormenting<03e0>Melphinians. Time to follow them to Numor<03e0>Mines and kick some ass!
The lord decided to hand over the Blue Elf<03e0>in exchange for the girls' lives. Guess this was the<03e0>big revenge Azelle was going on about, huh...
Nordis and Azelle, the two who have been<03e0>tormenting Melphina, got away and even<03e0>the knights couldn't catch them... That sucks.
I destroyed the royal troop of Mantroskylo,<03e0>protectors of the ancient desert kingdom.<03e0>We'll never know its history, but at least Balterossa's safe.
Royotia's marquis, Lord Priam, wants me to<03e0>go listen to the Flame Guardian's story.<03e0>It would help if I knew who that was...
That Vespalia is trying to destroy<03e0>Royotia. I need to collect nine Crimson Shards<03e0>and make it disappear!
Vespalia was terrorizing the town, but someone<03e0>defeated it. Good news, right? Wrong.<03e0>Someone stole the Emeth Tag during all the chaos!
The Vespalia monster is dead!<03e0>Royotia's out of danger. All's good!
Vespalia's been purged. Royotia is<03e0>completely safe! The girl seemed really<03e0>happy about that before she went off somewhere.
Seems like some monster called Validus is making<03e0>trouble in the Vale of the Gods. Me and Leshau've<03e0>gotta do something about it.
Validus is toast!<03e0>Leshau told me to take a break.
With Validus gone, the Brimuslabus was<03e0>handed over to the Academy.<03e0>Hope this means Baaluk's safe!
Leshau asked me to help him slay<03e0>the monster Validus, but it looks<03e0>like he went off on his own. And failed.
This qsiti in Balterossa wants me to defeat<03e0>a monster roaming around the Great Subterrane.<03e0>It's supposed to be strong. Really strong.
I killed the monster!<03e0>The qsiti seems to think there's some kind of<03e0>conspiracy, but who cares! The important thing is<07f0>I rock!
I killed the monster and the ancient hero.<03e0>I don't know why they kept fighting all these years.<03e0>Isn't there a better way to spend time...?
The ancient hero came back as a monster.<03e0>We have to go to the Great Subterrane and<03e0>stop him before he puts Balterossa in danger.
The hero-turned-monster is done for!<03e0>Balterossa is safe. Go me!
The hero-turned-monster is dead.<03e0>No one really knows how he transformed<03e0>into that thing. Not my problem, I guess.
A lady magus wants me to recover an old treasure<03e0>from the Great Sand Sea. She also gave me<03e0>a code: C-4-B-E-A-1. I wonder what it's for.
I used the code C-4-B-E-A-1 in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea and a little kid appeared.<03e0>I think he's trying to guide me somewhere.
I brought the ancient treasure back to the lady,<03e0>but she didn't seem to want it.<03e0>I don't understand women...
Some weirdo scientist guy from Melphina<03e0>somehow conned me into going to Yvalock's<03e0>Nest to get some "special" materials.
The scientist guy must have had a real traumatic<03e0>experience, because he seemed really bummed.<03e0>I couldn't say anything to cheer him up!
The scientist guy wants to try another experiment.<03e0>He asked me to get him more materials for<03e0>an "even better" concoction.
The scientist guy got stomped by some<03e0>girls he ticked off. I didn't know what to say,<03e0>so I decided to leave him alone.
The scientist guy decided to give it one more go.<03e0>Third time's a charm, right?<03e0>I really hope he gets what he wants this time...
The scientist guy failed again...<03e0>I don't think science is the way to go...
The scientist guy couldn't create anything<03e0>useful, so he decided to go on a journey<03e0>in search of more knowledge.
Baaluk's barkeep sent me to the Salamander's<03e0>Belly to exterminate some bugs. ...Some!?<03e0>There were billions! I got the job done, though.
According to the old man, there's some shady<03e0>business going on with some sleazy dudes<03e0>into human trafficking. They're in the Aqueducts.
I destroyed the slave-trading group hiding in the<03e0>Aqueducts. The kid's sister was returned safely.<03e0>The old man gave me a reward. Life is good!
Raphus from Royotia wants me to recover<03e0>something of his that he accidentally traded<03e0>to someone named Rainn from Balterossa.
I can get Raphus's treasure for the Ancient Scabbard,<03e0>but to get that, I need the Ring of<03e0>Morning Calm from Alyssa in Baaluk.
I bought the Ring of Morning Calm from<03e0>Alyssa to trade for the Ancient Scabbard later.
I traded the Ring of Morning Calm for the Ancient<03e0>Scabbard. I should be able to take it to Beauson<03e0>in Elysion to get Raphus's treasure back.
Raphus's map was traded to a lady who<03e0>mistakenly thought it was a map to<03e0>the Imperator's treasures.
Alyssa from Baaluk had Raphus's item, but<03e0>she threw it away. She told me that it's probably<03e0>still around here somewhere.
I got Raphus's map back in Baaluk.<03e0>I should go back to Royotia and tell him.
Raphus got his map back. It just looks like<03e0>an old map that has scribbles on it, but it<03e0>has memories of his wife.
Some Athlumian merchant asked me to be the bodyguard<03e0>for a surveyor down in the Gaslin Caves.<03e0>Something about trade routes to Balterossa...
I met up with the guy trying to establish a trade<03e0>route between Athlum and Balterossa.<03e0>Now to avoid the Jhana and get out of these caves.
I escorted the guy to the cave's exit.<03e0>I helped secure the trade routes. Score!
Some dude named Baulson asked me to find some<03e0>rich sick kid who got lost in the Gaslin Caves.
I helped a kid who got jumped by some thieves<03e0>in a cave, and got a reward from Baulson.<03e0>He said he'd help out if we needed him in the future.
Rhagoh from Celapaleis wants me to find the man<03e0>who's out getting flowers for his sister's grave.<03e0>I should head to Darken Forest.
I gave Rhagoh the flowers and told him about the<03e0>girl I met in the woods. He's decided he wants to<03e0>see if it's his sister. So...she's a ghost? Or a zombie!?
Some qsiti named Darien dared me to bring<03e0>him the sacred chalice from his hometown.<03e0>Bring it on, punk! ...Wait, where is his hometown?
I found out that Darien is from Melphina. Ha!<03e0>But I have no idea where the chalice is...
I got my hands on a cracked chalice.<03e0>Is this what he was talking about?<03e0>I guess I should show it to Darien, at least.
I handed the cracked chalice to Darien.<03e0>He looked really surprised, but now he<03e0>thinks I'm cool and wants to be part of the gang.
A mysterious woman handed me a letter to<03e0>deliver to a yama in the Robelia Ruins.<03e0>Man, I'm such a sucker for a pretty lady!
The yama got the letter. My part is done!
The mysterious lady disappeared.<03e0>I wonder what she meant when she<03e0>said that I had made a difference.
I bought some dodgy "Khrynia" potions from a magus-y<03e0>girl in Athlum. She ran off right afterwards, though.
I bought some dodgy "Khrynia" herbs from a magus-y<03e0>girl lost in Celapaleis. She seriously needs a map.
I bought some dodgy "Khrynia" explosives from a<03e0>magus-y girl lost in Elysion. She ran off<07f0>hopefully<03e0>this time she'll remember her compass.
I bought some dodgy "Khrynia" lotions from a magus-y<03e0>girl hanging around the Nagapur canals. She left in<03e0>search of a peaceful place.
I bought this dodgy "Khrynia" charm from a magus-y<03e0>girl who wants to remodel Ghor Castle. I'm sure the<03e0>Duke'll love that! She left in search of a historical town.
I bought this dodgy "Khrynia" ring from some magus-y<03e0>girl with personal problems. She left Undelwalt to visit<03e0>a border town.
I bought this dodgy "Khrynia" armband from a magus-y<03e0>girl who I'm starting to think has swindled me out of way<03e0>too much cash. She left to cross the Great Sand Sea.
That magus-y girl finally got a real job! I couldn't help<03e0>but buy ore off her. But then she quit to go someplace<03e0>with a fairy-tale feel. Women, who can understand 'em?
That magus-y girl was in Melphina, bummed since she<03e0>wasn't the only magus-y type around. Then I bought<03e0>something from her. Am I an enabler?
Found that magus-y girl in Baaluk, sick of living in the<03e0>boonies. Her name's Khrynia...I can't believe I didn't figure<03e0>that one out! Anyway, she left to become a mercenary.
I helped pummel the Third Committee with Nora<03e0>to help out the Bloody Alice members.<03e0>Too bad violence can't heal wounds from the past...
The Jhana were getting out of control, so I<03e0>helped Caedmon suppress them a bit.<03e0>I think they got the hint. Hehe.
We had to suppress the Jhana again.<03e0>This time we showed them we REALLY mean business.
Getting rid of the rest of the Conqueror's army<03e0>was satisfying! The Silver Falcons rock!<03e0>Oh, and they help maintain peace in the world.
Some really gloomy guy gave me a letter to give<03e0>to someone in a pub in Balterossa. I should<03e0>take the Southwestern Road to get there.
I delivered the letter to Balterossa.<03e0>I wonder what it was about...and why<03e0>he couldn't just use a mailman.

Rush, we are about to walk into a den of monsters, so<03e0>look sharp. We will be fine as long as we handle each<03e0>one individually.
Okay, got it.
Take this. It is an <1be064f4ecff>Alizarin Orb<1ce0>.<03e0>It will enable you to use mystic arts.
Mystic arts?
Perhaps the term "spell" is more common... It's a way<03e0>to channel energy through your weapon, with fantastic<03e0>results.
Huh...
With this <1be064f4ecff>Alizarin Orb<1ce0>, you can channel spells through<03e0>your weapons as well. Now you can attack enemies<03e0>with mystic arts.
Cool! Thanks a lot!
Additionally, let me give you this map of the area.<03e0>With these, you should be ready for anything.<03e0>Now then, shall we go on?
pagusThis gate is a Remnant.<03e0>Only the one bound to it may open it.
rush_sykes_sSo what do we do?
pagusHmm... When it comes down to it, it IS a door...<03e0>It stands to reason that it would have a key.
pagusThis is it. This Remnant is the key.<03e0>Let's try it on that door.

The door is bolted.<03e0>Remove the bolt?<06e0000008e0000000000000>It looks light enough.<09e008e0010000000300>Nah, it looks too heavy.

Hey there, buddy! This's the heart of the mining<03e0>city of Royotia, Byon Sector. There ain't much<03e0>to do, but feel free to make yourself at home.<04e0>That range of mountains over there is the Altonas.<03e0>Mt. Altona's actually a volcano, and if it ever<03e0>blew its top, we'd all be barbeque.<04e0>But it's okay, 'cause we got that big rock there<07f003e0>that's the Emeth Tag.

Believe it or not, I haven't been spending my<03e0>years longing to chit-chat with some mitra child.
Are you truly as imbecilic as you look?<03e0>I have nothing to say to you.<04e0>Ugh, I have absolutely no idea how Torgal can<03e0>stand to live around such idiots.
I have no idea how Torgal stands to live around<03e0>such idiots without killing himself...or you.
You again?<04e0>That reminds me... The smallest of your Four<03e0>Generals was saying... "My, Allan, even though<03e0>you're sovani too, you act so differently!"<04e0>What the hell is that supposed to mean!? Trying to<03e0>insult me, is that it? That qsiti's getting too big<03e0>for its nonexistent britches, don't you think?<04e0>Next time you see that little thing, you'd better<03e0>tell him to watch his abnormally long tongue if<03e0>he wishes to keep it!<04e0>...<04e0>No. It's not worth getting this worked up over<03e0>a tiny thing like this. Just...forget about this, boy.
Rrgh... I can't let myself be baited by the words<03e0>of some pathetic qsiti...
You again.<04e0>That reminds me... I saw Torgal get angry at one<03e0>of your Four Generals...that hulking lump of a<03e0>fish-man.<04e0>And all over something as insignificant as sneaking<03e0>food. Ah, the lofty concerns of the famed Four<03e0>Generals...simpletons.<04e0>You know, I'd never seen him make such an overt<03e0>reaction before, never. In fact, the prideful bastard<03e0>would brag that only fools would show any emotion...<04e0>Good god, what in the seven hells happened to<03e0>you, Torgal!? How could you change so, you<03e0>hypocritical<07f004e0>...<04e0>Tsk...not again... Ugh, what is making me so angry?<03e0>Even he is not worth that. It must be a side-effect<03e0>of having to debase myself to talk to you!
Rrgh... I can't believe I let myself get this worked<03e0>up over Torgal, no matter how galling he acts...
Hmph, you again.<04e0>It seems that Torgal has found someone else he's<03e0>willing to confide in. Someone other than me... Well.<03e0>Fine. It's fine. I'm glad to be rid of his piddling concerns.<04e0>...What. What is that look for? Are you laughing at<03e0>me? Let's see if you're still laughing when I rip you<03e0>limb from limb!<04e0>...<04e0>...That is,<03e0>I believe now I understand why Torgal keeps you<03e0>around. You people do keep things lively, don't you?<04e0>I never felt this way when I lived apart from<03e0>you other races.<04e0>I always considered those who let themselves be<03e0>rankled by little things to be ridiculously foolish.<04e0>And yet, after having spent this time traveling<03e0>with you people, I've found myself increasingly<03e0>burdened by these...feelings.<04e0>Odd... As time passes, the less I've thought that<03e0>to be a bad thing... You people are truly the strangest<03e0>group I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.<04e0>I had planned to leave such a cloyingly buddy-buddy<03e0>group at once, but for some reason you amuse me...<03e0>Perhaps I'll stick around a bit longer.<04e0>...What's that look for? You don't like it!? Don't<03e0>think I was joking about that limb-from-limb bit.
What do you want?<04e0>I've decided I'll go with you people for a little longer.
Ah<07f0>Rush! You startled me. To be honest, I'm trying to<03e0>lay low for a bit. Could you leave me be for now?
Ehh!?<03e0>A-ahh, Rush...<04e0>...<04e0>Well, so long as we're to be fighting together,<03e0>there's no need to keep hiding this from you,<03e0>I suppose...<04e0>I don't know if you know it or not, but I was<03e0>once a general in the Celapaleian army.<04e0>I'm not the strongest of people, but my pride and<03e0>devotion to my position is still unmatched by anyone.<04e0>However...<03e0>Everything changed after...<04e0>Hum hum?<04e0>That yama over there<07f0>did he just move? He did,<03e0>didn't he? ...I'm sorry, this is all I can say for now.<03e0>Constant vigilance, after all...<04e0>For now, please let me alone.
Forgive me, Rush.<03e0>For now, please leave me alone.
Hmm...<03e0>Seems like that yama isn't here today.<04e0>Alright, then...<03e0>Let me continue from last time.<04e0>Why is it that I, a former general of the Celapaleian<03e0>army, am now scuttling about, on the run...?<04e0>It's due to the secrets I know...secrets about my<03e0>lord, Duke Qubine.<04e0>Let me tell you, life as a fugitive is not the fun that<03e0>it seems. But of late, I've been impressed by how<03e0>long I've been able to run, if I may say so myself.<04e0>I mean, the search for me is a direct order from<03e0>Duke Qubine. It is something to catch the attention<03e0>of the majority of Celapaleis's army.<04e0>Ho ho ho!<03e0>Didn't expect that, now did you!<04e0>Hwha<07f0>?<04e0>Rush<07f0>did you see that?<03e0>Just now, over there, on that wagon! That qsiti<03e0>looks mighty suspicious!<04e0>No...I had best not say anything further.<03e0>Go, get away...you don't know me.
Not now<07f0>who knows who is watching us?
Oh, Rush. Is it time to leave yet?<04e0>Lately, it seems my pursuers have increased in<03e0>number and tenacity... I'd like to avoid staying in<03e0>public places for too long if at all possible.<04e0>Hrm.<03e0>It seems as if my flight is about to come to an end...<04e0>No, no need to worry. I've no intention of giving up<03e0>now. I'll continue to run so long as my feet will move.<04e0>However... If something were to happen to me, I<03e0>want you to flee, and don't turn back. I have no<03e0>intention of causing trouble for you or Pagus.<04e0>You know, since meeting up with you all, even<03e0>these days as a fugitive have been truly enjoyable.<03e0>...I probably should speak to Sibal as well.<04e0>Alright. Go on, go on.
This time traveling with you all has truly<03e0>been enjoyable.<03e0>I should go speak with Sibal as well...
Oh, Rush!<03e0>Is it true that Duke Qubine's been struck down<03e0>by some unknown illness?<04e0>Hrn... That Conqueror...it must be his doing. In the<03e0>end, we weren't able to catch him after all...<04e0>Hm? What's that look for?<04e0>Oh, yes...forgive me.<03e0>I suppose I have some explaining to do...<04e0>In truth, I was given a special mission by Duke<03e0>Qubine<07f0>to gather information on the Conqueror.<03e0>Sadly, I was unable to find much of use...<04e0>But, I am quite an actor, hm? I had you and Sibal<03e0>all thinking I was some delusional old man, didn't I!<04e0>Ho ho ho ho ho!<03e0>Come now, don't be angry. It was a cover story...<03e0>Nothing personal, I assure you.<04e0>...<04e0>Rush. It's terrible to think of, but the Conqueror<03e0>still lives. If left to do as he pleases, the world will<03e0>once again be thrown into confusion.<04e0>I want to stop that from happening at any cost.<03e0>...Consider it the final request of an old man who's<03e0>spent the better part of his life fighting.<04e0>And, that's how things are. I hope to continue to<03e0>have your help into the future. I'm counting on you!
Oh! Hello there, Rush. Lately my pursuers have<03e0>decreased by quite a bit... I can't decide if that's<03e0>a good thing or not, however.
Hm?<03e0>A plot to tunnel beneath Ghor Castle?<03e0>Ho ho ho ho ho!<04e0>Really now, do you think the Duke of Ghor<03e0>would allow such a thing?<04e0>Goodness, Sibal has gone on about that for years,<03e0>no point in trying to change his mind now. Can't<03e0>teach old Jhana new tricks, you know?
Huh?<03e0>What're you doing here, old lady?
Wha<07f0>excuse me?<03e0>Do I even know you?
Oh, oops.<03e0>Um, I thought you were someone else...
Hmph! Make sure you have the right<03e0>person next time!
S-sorry...
Hmph... I'll let it slide this time. Of course, that's on<03e0>the condition that there's never a second.
Calling someone "old lady" is rude and inconsiderate...<03e0>especially when they aren't old!
Hm? You again.
Uh.
You don't look happy to see me.
Uh, n-no, that's not true!<03e0>Say, ol<07f0>O beautiful young maid, what're you doing<03e0>around here?
Training.<03e0>In my family, it's a rite of passage<03e0>to travel the world.
Huh... Sounds pretty tough.<03e0>Take care of yourself, okay?
Thank you.
You're not as inconsiderate as I thought.
You're looking well.
Heya, Ms. Young Maiden.
Could you please not call me that?<03e0>It sounds ridiculous, to say the least.
Well, it's not like I know your name.
Oh?
...
The name's Emmy.
Nice to meet you for real, finally.<03e0>I'm<07f001e00be00ae0>
Rush. Rush Sykes.<03e0>Right?
Wha<07f0>? How did you know!?
I have my ways.
Take care, Rush.
What's the purpose of my training?<03e0>Well...a lot of things. But in general,<03e0>training the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.

What? Do you need something?
What do you want?
Have you seen Lord David?<04e0>I do not feel comfortable letting him alone.<03e0>If you see him, please tell him I am looking for him.
What a troublemaker...
...
On the surface, it does not seem like this place<03e0>has changed very much...<04e0>That said, it is no place to let Lord David run about<03e0>unsupervised.<03e0>If you see him, tell him I am looking for him.
You haven't seen Lord David?
If it was only going to be stolen anyway, we should<03e0>have taken the Remnant ourselves...<04e0>...No, Lord David would never have stood for it.
Please forget I said anything.
The Remnant Ark...<03e0>Surely there must be a similar Remnant elsewhere<03e0>in the world...
I can think of nothing...
Lord David is as prepared as he can be.<04e0>All I have to do is to follow.
Ahh... What a spectacular Remnant.<03e0>It just has a certain presence, doesn't it?<03e0>I feel as if I'd never tire of looking at it...<04e0>However...<03e0>It doesn't look all that different from any<03e0>other rock, does it...
Incredible...
...
After learning of Remnants disappearing the world over,<03e0>I'd become more a bit wary, but look. This place is the<03e0>same as always...it's a small but appreciated blessing.
Yes, yes.
Then, it's just like Athlum...<04e0>The whole mood of the town is different.
What in the world is going on?
It must exist, somewhere...
Let's continue to search.
Let's finish this...learn the true ending of this tale.
Come and check out the weapons they have!<03e0>Ahh, from blunt to sharp, fancy decorative stuff<03e0>to everyday weapons, I love 'em all!
Heheheheh...
Lady Emma...
Heya, Rush! Check it out<07f0>the Remnant's still alive<03e0>and kicking!<03e0>So we can't get all down either, right?
We can't lose hope now!
Even the weapons seem kinda pooped out...<03e0>Guess it's 'coz the Remnant's gone...
Geez, even the weapons seem pooped out...
Gah, if I have to think about this Remnant stuff<03e0>any more, my head's gonna explode! You just tell<03e0>me where to go when you've figured it out, okay?
I'm ready to rock whenever!
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>Don't worry<07f0>I'll knock down anybody in our way!
What am I doing?<04e0>Just as it looks, taking a walk. As the Marquis,<03e0>I can't just roam the streets alone in Athlum<03e0>or Celapaleis...<04e0>I'm certain Torgal is having conniptions, but let's<03e0>keep this between us, shall we?
Remember, you never saw me.
It seems the Emeth Tag is still untouched...
...
Royotia as well...<04e0>Then, Athlum is not the only victim...
...
What am I rushing around for?<03e0>To be honest, I was mainly trying not to be recognized...
I hope we're not too late...
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>And we'll return together<07f0>victorious!
The town may look the same as always, but<03e0>that's only at first glance.<04e0>There's plenty of rumbling beneath the surface...<03e0>This is no time to start slacking.
This place is rotten...
They've lost their Remnant as well...<03e0>I suppose it could be just coincidence...<04e0>Certainly seems like a plot, though...
I can't believe someone isn't behind all this...
Hey now, quit playing around and help us search,<03e0>will you? There's got to be another way to get to<03e0>the Sacred Lands, but we won't find it if you don't look.
Don't worry<07f0>we'll find it.
I'll look after Lord David since she cannot...<03e0>So you'd better do the same for Irina.

Hey, kid. Have you been to the southern cave,<03e0>Siebenbur, yet? There're ruins a thousand years<03e0>old down there.<04e0>We mercs are regularly hired as bodyguards by<03e0>excavation groups and scholars wanting to see<03e0>the ruins.<04e0>It's not bad money, if you've got the patience<03e0>to deal with the jabbering of scholarly types.<04e0>Thing is... It's rumored there's some giant<03e0>monsters running around and breaking up the<03e0>veins of ore.<04e0>Eh, I've never come across one, but I'm sure I<03e0>could easily take down one or two single-<03e0>handed!
Finding a lode of Damascus ore is the dream of every<03e0>miner in Royotia... The ore's so valuable, finding some'd<03e0>be a one-way ticket to riches.<04e0>However, the ore is real rare, and there aren't many<03e0>folk who've found a vein. It's rumored there's some in<03e0>Lavafender, but... That's a hell of a place to dig...literally!

Welcome to the Firestone!
So I was digging when I ended up all the way in<03e0>Lavafender. Guess I got carried away... Anyway,<03e0>that's when I see it...<04e0>I swear to Marion this wasn't a mirage<07f0>but I'm<03e0>in this sweltering-hot cave full of lava and I see<03e0>this young girl just standing there, all alone.<04e0>So, of course, I go to her<07f0>I mean, it's<03e0>dangerous, no place for some little slip of a<03e0>girl<07f0>and get this: she disappears.<04e0>Insane, right? I figure she's gotta be a ghost<03e0>with unfinished business. That's the only<03e0>explanation.<04e0>Hey, I toldja it wasn't a mirage! I know what I<03e0>saw!
Apparently Lord Priam's in bad shape.<04e0>It's real hard to believe, though<07f0>he's always<03e0>been healthier than even us miners. He ain't<03e0>the type to get sick, 'specially not bad as this.<04e0>It's damned frustrating... Alls we can do is try<03e0>and dig up some expensive ore, and try and hire<03e0>a healer from abroad.
Right before that Conqueror bastard marched<03e0>into town, this freaky voice like a bird call or<03e0>something was heard all over town.<04e0>For some reason, hearing it made me think of<03e0>that ghost I saw down in Lavafender that one<03e0>time...<04e0>Maybe the whole reason the Conqueror could<03e0>take the Emeth Tag in the first place was<03e0>because of the ghost's curse!<04e0>...Nah, that's crazy talk. I'm just freaking<03e0>myself out...
Long time ago, deep within the earth's molten<03e0>core, twin birds signifying good and evil were<03e0>locked in eternal battle.<04e0>The founder of Royotia saved the bird of virtue.<03e0>In return, he gained weapons strong enough to<03e0>defeat and take over the surrounding lands.<04e0>However, the bird of virtue fought again with<03e0>the bird of evil, and lost. The founder was<03e0>absorbed into the evil beast.<04e0>When all was almost lost, the bird of virtue<03e0>began to sing a lament...a lullaby.<04e0>Upon hearing the sad, gentle song, the bird of<03e0>evil fell asleep and sank beneath the lava, to<03e0>slumber for eternity.<04e0>That legend has been told in this land for<03e0>hundreds of years. Still, there aren't too many<03e0>people interested in such fairytales nowadays.
I heard from Lord Paris that you had defeated<03e0>the bird of evil, Vespalia, once and for all.<04e0>I never would have thought that the legend was<03e0>real...<04e0>The only reason Royotia still stands today is<03e0>due to you. I speak for the entire town when I<03e0>say you have our thanks.
Just before the Conqueror's army marched on<03e0>Royotia, the harsh sound of a bird's call could<03e0>be heard all through the city.<04e0>That legend...it wasn't just a fairytale. The<03e0>bird of virtue's seal has broken. The bird of<03e0>evil has awakened.<04e0>Whether the Conqueror returns here or not,<03e0>Royotia is finished...
Hrmm, ain't nothing interesting goin' on at all.
Do you know Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis? Seems his<03e0>wife's disappeared. Probably left him...it wouldn't be the<03e0>first time. Or the second...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Baron Nielsen...my eternal rival! I'll beat you yet...<03e0>Whenever you realize we have a rivalry, anyway.
Yeah, yeah!
Seems like there's some crazy woman plotting to<03e0>assassinate Duke Qubine...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Duke Qubine...what a disagreeable ruler!<03e0>...I guess. Not like we've met or anything.
Like you ever could!
So, the desert princess has been sneaking out of<03e0>the castle to meet some guy she's been mooning over.<03e0>Sounds kinda dangerous to me...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The desert princess is my biggest fan!<03e0>...I wish, anyway.
Impossible!
Hey!<03e0>So, the desert princess has eloped with her man!
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Eloping...this man is also my rival!<03e0>...If only he knew it.
Not likely!
Relations between Royotia and Balterossa have taken<03e0>a nosedive lately. The families of soldiers are really<03e0>worried that war is unavoidable.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Balterossa...my beloved Royotia will deal you<03e0>a crushing blow! ...Someday.
Keep hope alive!
So there's supposed to be something the Imperator<03e0>sealed out in the great swamp...<03e0>Problem is, the seal's broken...oops!
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Imperator<07f0>another one of my rivals!<03e0>...If he were still alive, that is.
Riiight.
So, one of the Forest Maidens bound to those<03e0>Order of Melphina knights can sense what he's<03e0>sensing.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Forest Maidens...more of my fans!<03e0>...That would be incredible, huh?
Impossible!
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina<03e0>are mobilizing... Seems something's happened to<03e0>the Last Leaf in Crookfen.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Last Leaf...I've never seen it and thus have<03e0>nothing to say about it. Next!
Boo...
It's almost time for Kosmosfest, huh.<03e0>But apparently the Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to<03e0>Nagapur yet. Maybe she got mixed up in something...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Cosmos Maiden...another of my fans!<03e0>...That would be incredible, wouldn't it?
Impossible!
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started<03e0>the Kosmosfest alright. Usually the ceremony's a bunch<03e0>of hooey, but this time it was interrupted by monsters.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Kosmosfest! I've never seen it and thus have<03e0>nothing to say about it. ...Next!
Boo...
Some old-fashioned chick is looking to hire<03e0>bodyguards, I hear. She's supposed to be hanging out<03e0>at the pub near the canal.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Ancient lady<07f0>I'm sure she's a fan of me!<03e0>...Right?
Impossible!
Apparently a lot of the treasures of the Old Kingdoms<03e0>are turning up on the black market.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The treasures of the Old Kingdoms...they were all<03e0>stolen by me! ...Okay, sorry. That's a lie.
Not a funny joke!
Some guy is looking for these three stones that're<03e0>really important to the desert.<03e0>Historically significant, or something.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Three stones...they belong to me!<03e0>...Okay, sorry. That's a lie.
Not a funny joke!
Some guy into ancient magick is looking for people<03e0>to help out with research. Seems he's on the verge<03e0>of unlocking some huge mysteries.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>A researcher<07f0>obviously he is my rival!<03e0>...I think.
Nooot really.
So some folks are crying it's the end of the world<03e0>over some freaky monster. Apparently it was sealed<03e0>by the Imperator, and now it's back...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Freaky monster...obviously you are my rival!<03e0>...Okay, no, I wouldn't have a chance against it.
Definitely no chance.
Some amnesiac is wandering around the cities in<03e0>the desert, looking for something that could regain<03e0>his memory.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph.<03e0>Amnesiac...obviously you are my rival!<03e0>...Though I guess you wouldn't know it.
I think you're unforgettable, boss!
Recently people've been seeing this infamous bandit<03e0>around Athlum. Apparently he's waiting around for<03e0>someone but no one's brave enough to ask who.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Infamous bandit...obviously you are my rival!<03e0>...Hey, I'd be a better bandit than you'd think.
...Is that something to be proud of?
There's a goddess statue in the Robelia Ruins that'll<03e0>let you meet anyone in the world, no matter how far.<03e0>Some kid who lost his sister is totally into it...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Goddess statues...I've never seen them and thus<03e0>have nothing to say about them. Next!
Boo...
There's a murderer on the loose in the capital!
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Murderer...obviously you are my rival!<03e0>...I feel as if I should catch up.
You can't be serious...
There's some massive yama sayin' he's lost his<03e0>stuff, but he's kind of a weirdo so people're givin'<03e0>him a wide berth.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Massive yama...you must be my rival!
Certainly a rival in the strange department!
Some white qsiti's been looking for a magickal book.<03e0>People seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's<03e0>been able to place him.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>White qsiti! You must be another of my rivals!<03e0>...For reasons I cannot quite explain.
If you say so!
There's these twins that've turned up as mercenaries<03e0>lately...good ones, too. The one girl is supposed to be<03e0>a real cool customer<07f0>both in looks, and in attitude.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Twin mercenaries...obviously both are huge fans!<03e0>...Even if they don't quite know it yet.
Impossible!
Some guy out in the Great Sand Sea's been looking<03e0>for challengers for some game. Seems like<03e0>they've gotta be pretty impressive, too.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Game-playing man...you, too, are my rival!
You don't even know what the game is...
Some old warrior's been crossing the Great Sand<03e0>Sea, looking for a special sword.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Old warrior...you, too, are my rival!<03e0>...If only you knew that.
Riiight.
A bunch of guards somewhere have sworn to<03e0>follow their ruler for as long as they live.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Ruler of somewhere...you, too, are my rival!<03e0>...I wonder where that "somewhere" is.
Good question.
There's not a family in the world as dedicated as<03e0>the Honeywells. If you've got them at your back,<03e0>you can do anything.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph! The Honeywells...their<03e0>blood runs through my veins! ...Er, my mother's sister's<03e0>cousin's grandmother's niece's friend!
That's not related to you at all!
So, Athlum's General Torgal is supposed to have<03e0>some past what's coming back to haunt him. Stuff<03e0>here, in Royotia...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>This General Torgal...you, too, are my rival!<03e0>...If only you knew I existed.
Whatever you say, boss.
It's about time for the Tournament of Heroes to start<03e0>up again. It's pretty well-known among the types with<03e0>fighting spirit.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Heroic tournament...I've never heard of it and thus<03e0>have nothing to say about it. Next!
Boo...
Apparently there's some mystic academy that's been<03e0>spitting out skilled magi for years.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Mystic academy...I've never heard of it and thus<03e0>have nothing to say about it. Next!
Boo...
Athlum's been going through some tough times, and<03e0>people are worried about the new matriarch of<03e0>the Honeywell clan because she's so young.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Honeywell matriarch...obviously she, too, is one<03e0>of my fans! ...At least, that would be nice.
Impossible!
Recently there's been gossip about Athlum's Marquis'<03e0>love interests...or lack thereof. He's never been<03e0>connected with anybody. Wonder if he's a eunuch?
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Marquis of Athlum...you, too, are my rival!<03e0>...Impressive, don't you think?
Definitely a surprise.
The old head of the Academy's been seen in pubs<03e0>across the continent lately. I guess it stands to reason<03e0>she'd want to drown her sorrows after what happened.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The former head of the Academy...you, too, are my<03e0>rival! ...Or should that be my fan?
Make up your mind!
Those Sykes scientists have been seen going in and<03e0>out of Athlum Castle a lot lately. Guess they<03e0>discovered somethin' new?
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Doctor Marina Sykes...obviously she is my fan!<03e0>...At least, it'd be pretty impressive if so.
Impossible!

Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Female warrior...another of my fans!<03e0>...That would be incredible, wouldn't it?
Impossible!
Some monster army's appeared in the Great Sand Sea.<03e0>They're so powerful that everyone in Balterossa is<03e0>totally in despair...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Monster hordes...I could destroy them with a flick<03e0>of my wrist! ...Okay, sorry. That's a lie.
Not a funny joke!
According to ancient historians, there's something<03e0>dangerous enough to destroy entire cities sealed<03e0>within the volcano...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Volcano...I've never seen it and thus have nothing<03e0>to say about it. Next!
Seriously!? It's right outside...
No one knows anything about the stuff going on inside<03e0>the volcano, nor does anyone know how to find out...<03e0>Maybe Marquis Priam knows something?
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Inside the volcano! I've never seen it and thus have<03e0>nothing to say about it. Next!
I guess most people haven't seen the inside of a<03e0>volcano...
You know there's a town without anyone running it?<03e0>The old ruler's sons are fighting over the seat of power.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>A rulerless town? Obviously I must go there and run it!<03e0>...Except it kinda sounds like a hassle, so I'll pass.
Make up your mind!
When you're out in the desert, you can hear this sad,<03e0>lonely voice crying from beneath the Great Sand Sea.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Beneath the desert...I've never seen it and thus<03e0>have nothing to say about it. Next!
Boo...
A long time ago, there used to be a famed hero that<03e0>lived in the Great Sand Sea.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Famed hero...you, too, are my rival!<03e0>...If only you were still alive.
Being dead for a couple hundred years does put a<03e0>damper on the rivalry, huh.
So I was walking through town and heard this guy all<03e0>"you gotta believe me! If you look at the pillars in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea, then...g-g-gra<07f0>!"
An' that's the story!

You...you can't be serious...
Some crackpot old scientist has been wandering around<03e0>Melphina. If you go over there, you probably should<03e0>stay away, he's giving people strange looks.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Crackpot scientist...you, too, are my rival!

The cafe out in Baaluk's supposedly infested with<03e0>bugs...they followed the guy all the way from the desert.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Swarming bugs...you, too, are my rival!

Nagapur's been increasingly unsafe. Recently a<03e0>bunch of kids have gone missing...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Nagapur...I've never been there and thus<03e0>have nothing to say about it. Next!
Boo...
Yeah, so adventurers have started trading the<03e0>different loot they find on their trips. Seems the fad's<03e0>based right here in Royotia!
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Trading loot...I've done that as well!<03e0>...I think.
Don't you know?
Royotian merchants are getting frustrated with<03e0>Balterossa...they control all of their trade routes.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Balterossa...I've never been there.<03e0>...Wonder what it's like.
...Are you serious?
Some yamaan mercenary's out looking for a partner.<03e0>Could be a good way to make a few G.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Yama mercenary...you, too, are my rival!<03e0>...If I knew who you were.
Riiight.
Some crazy guy's just shown up in Celapaleis.<03e0>He'll seem all normal and then will flip out and yell<03e0>at people at the drop of a hat.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Random crazy guy...you, too, are my rival!<03e0>...And a true one, I believe.
I'll agree with that one...
Some crazy qsiti's been going to crowded places and<03e0>picking fights with people who run into him. What<03e0>an annoyance...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Annoying qsiti...you, too, are my rival!
In being annoying?
Some mysterious lady's been looking for someone<03e0>to help her out. Seems something pretty serious's<03e0>been dropped on her plate.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Mysterious lady...obviously, you, too, are my fan!<03e0>...I hope so, anyway!
Impossible!
You've probably seen them if you've been hanging<03e0>around Crookfen, but Bloody Alice has been gathering.<03e0>Looks like something big's going on...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Ladies of Bloody Alice...obviously, they are all<03e0>my fans!
Riiight.
Seems the Jhana have been popping up in the Great<03e0>Sand Sea. Didn't Athlum just beat them up not too<03e0>long ago?
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Jhana...I could destroy them all myself!<03e0>...Okay, sorry. That's a lie.
Not a funny joke!
Recently the Silver Falcons took out a pack of Jhana.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Silver Falcons...the whole lot of them are my<03e0>rivals! ...I'm sure at least one of them realizes this.
I'm not so sure myself...
The Silver Falcons have been going after the<03e0>leftovers of the Conqueror's army. Who knows<03e0>what those guys could be up to...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Conqueror...you, too, are my rival!
In what!?
Some gloomy-looking guy's been hanging around<03e0>the pub in Elysion recently...bumming everyone out.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Gloomy man...you, too, are my rival!<03e0>...Though I'm in good spirits, myself.
Makes it not sound like much of a rivalry...

I am Priam, Marquis of Royotia.<04e0>You are the fabled adventurer, then? It seems<03e0>you have done a lot for my people.<04e0>I will be looking forward to your further exploits.
I am Priam, Marquis of Royotia.<04e0>As you can see, our fair city is surrounded on<03e0>all sides by nature's unforgiving strength. Yet<03e0>my people live strong and free. <04e0>Thus I will protect them so this may always<03e0>be the truth.
For some reason, my body fails me of late...<04e0>It's as if some mysterious power is pulling at<03e0>me...wanting me to<07f004e0>No...never mind. I just don't know what's come<03e0>over me... This weakness is not like me.
Forgive me...you've come so far, but if you<03e0>could come back later it would be appreciated.
I am Priam, Marquis of Royotia.<04e0>As you can see, our fair city is surrounded on<03e0>all sides by nature's unforgiving strength. Yet<03e0>my people live strong and free. <04e0>I intend on protecting them from now on.
Rush. My gratitude for the Balterossa incident. Thanks to you<03e0>and my son, we suffered much fewer losses than I'd feared.<04e0>Still, Paris still has a lot to learn about politics. He still seems<03e0>a bit awkward with these matters of state.
Still, Paris still has a lot to learn about politics. He still seems<03e0>a bit awkward with these matters of state.
The Flame Guardian's prayers went unanswered.<03e0>I have no more use for this key.
I am Priam, Marquis of Royotia...
For some reason, my body fails me of late...<03e0>I just don't know what's come over me. This weakness<03e0>is simply shameful.
Lately my son seems to be troubled by something...<03e0>That's just how he is... He comes across situations that<03e0>cannot be helped and tries to help them anyway...<04e0>Paris is not like me at all...far too kind.<03e0>Just like his mother...
I cannot believe that son of mine... The next<03e0>leader of Royotia, and he's off gallivanting across<03e0>the continent?<04e0>Though...I suppose I traveled the world before<03e0>becoming Marquis myself. That trip gained me<03e0>many things...dear friends, my beloved wife...<04e0>*sigh* I suppose this is a great opportunity for<03e0>him to grow...I certainly cannot begrudge him that.
I am Paris, heir to the territory of Royotia. Our<03e0>town may not have much to offer, but please<03e0>enjoy it as you can.
I'm really worried about Father...
My father's never been sick a day of his life,<03e0>and now he's so weak he can barely stand...<04e0>If only we could determine the cause of this<03e0>illness, then I could save my father from this<03e0>torture!
Thank you, Rush.<03e0>If you ever need my help, ask for me at the<03e0>guild hall. I shall do all I can.
Father blames himself for the loss of the Emeth Tag...<03e0>If only there were something I could do to help<03e0>relieve his sorrow...
You are in the presence of the Marquis of<03e0>Royotia.<03e0>Please be silent.
The relationship between countries is very<03e0>much affected by the countries that surround<03e0>them.
You are in the presence of the Marquis.<03e0>Please be silent.
It seemed like the Balterossa army<03e0>suffered heavy losses.
You are in the presence of Marquis Priam.<03e0>Quiet yourself!
Master Paris and Lady Charlotte are still very young.<03e0>I fear they will suffer many hardships in the future...
Hello.<03e0>Rush, I shall never forget your help in keeping<03e0>Royotia and Balterossa from war.
Rush, is there anyone you truly admire?<03e0>I suppose my biggest hero is my father.<04e0>Father became Marquis when he was the age I am<03e0>now. He was able to unite and lead the Royotian<03e0>people. Even after Mother died, he never faltered.<04e0>I cannot help but look to him with pride, not<03e0>only as a son, but as a citizen of Royotia.
It may sound hackneyed, but my personal hero is<03e0>my father. I look up to him not only as a son, but as<03e0>a citizen of Royotia.
Rush... Your father is the famous Dr. Sykes, is<03e0>he not? Do you ever find yourself compared to him?<04e0>My father is a master fencer... But not only is<03e0>he skilled in combat, his character is such that he<03e0>immediately won the hearts of the people.<04e0>Compared to that, what have I to offer? Nothing...<03e0>I cannot help but look upon myself with shame.<04e0>Someone like me ought not even dream of<03e0>becoming a man like him...<04e0>Forgive me. I-I must be boring you.<03e0>Please, er, forget what I was talking about.
The more I see my father, the more unworthy I<03e0>realize I am...
What's this?<03e0>It's a brooch...a gift from my mother when I<03e0>was very young. It's quite old, now...<04e0>My mother always said the soul was like a mirror...<04e0>The feelings you show will always be returned.<03e0>Thus, don't meet others with anger or hatred,<03e0>but with kindness and charity.<04e0>I always admired that about my mother...<04e0>Yet, kindness isn't enough to rule, is it...<03e0>It seems that instead of kindness, strength is<03e0>what's needed to guide the people.<04e0>Ah<07f0> Forgive me. I did not mean to unload my<03e0>thoughts on you, Rush.
For some reason, I always find myself opening my heart<03e0>to you, Rush. It's strange...
I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I've decided<03e0>there's no use in trying to compare myself to Father.<04e0>I remembered something else Mother always told me...<04e0>Everyone has their own strengths. Instead of<03e0>comparing them to those of others, we must find<03e0>how to use them best...<04e0>I am a different man from my father.<03e0>Thus, I must earn the trust of the Royotian people<03e0>in my own way.<04e0>It's taken a long time, but in travelling with you,<03e0>and finding my place here, I've been able to come<03e0>to this conclusion.<04e0>My whole life, I've felt equally honored and cursed<03e0>to be the future ruler of Royotia.<04e0>Finally I feel like I can get past my insecurities and<03e0>begin to move forward.<04e0>Rush, please allow me to continue to journey with<03e0>you. I realize I have a great deal more to learn so<03e0>that someday, I'll be someone to be proud of...
Hello, Rush! Please continue to allow me to travel<03e0>with you. I still have a good deal to learn so that I<03e0>can be a great leader to my people.

There are a lot of soldiers out there who brag about past<03e0>experiences, but it's hard to know who's telling the truth.<04e0>All I know is that anyone who says they've been to<03e0>Siebenbur is a real man<07f0>or a real liar.<04e0>But all the rumors kinda make me wonder what's so<03e0>scary about the place...

Welcome to the Blessed Chime!
Welcome to the Blessed Chime!<04e0>You wish for an audience with the God Emperor?<04e0>Oh my. Only the most important of people are allowed<03e0>an audience with his majesty.<04e0>I'm afraid you're asking the impossible.

It's hard to believe you defeated<03e0>such a gigantic monster!<03e0>You are a true hero!
Undelwalt was once the most prosperous<03e0>city in the world until the God Emperor<03e0>became nothing more than a figurehead.<04e0>It pains me to think about it.
The Blessed Chime has been around<03e0>since the days of the Imperator.<03e0>This place holds history.<04e0>The customers who used to come here<03e0>were very refined. You can't tell from<03e0>looking around the place today, though.
The Harmonium used to sparkle as it<03e0>reflected sunlight off its sides.<03e0>It was a beautiful sight.<04e0>Now it's covered in a greenish tint.<03e0>It could mean the Harmonium's bind<03e0>is coming to an end.
Imperial city, my ass!<03e0>It's pretty to look at, but it's empty inside.<04e0>Kinda like the God Emperor himself.
There is nothing to talk about today.
That is not true.<03e0>There is always love and compassion.

I just pray whatever action they take,<03e0>the beauty of the landscape will not be harmed.
Indeed.
It seems Kosmosfest has yet to begin because<03e0>the Cosmos Maiden has not arrived. Everyone prays<03e0>she is safe.
This is the talk of the town, my lady.
I would like to attend this festival.<03e0>Perhaps if I leave now, they will put<03e0>it on hold till I arrive.
Indeed.
The Cosmos Maiden has arrived and the festival will<03e0>begin shortly. It is a shame that the tranquil<03e0>event is always disrupted by monsters.
This is the talk of the town, my lady.
Why would the monsters do that?<03e0>Who would try to ruin a perfectly<03e0>wonderful evening?
Indeed.
An old-fashioned woman is seeking<03e0>a bodyguard. She waits in the pub in<03e0>the town with the canals.

Indeed.
The treasures from different lands bestowed<03e0>upon the holy city have been stolen and<03e0>are being sold on the black market.

Indeed.

Indeed.

Ho there, traveler! This is the "front gate" of Balterossa,<03e0>the Merchant's Lot.<04e0>Traveling merchants stop here to take a break during<03e0>their long journeys or talk shop with other merchants.<03e0>You should take a load off, too!

Ho there, traveler! This is the "front gate" of<03e0>Balterossa, the Merchant Lot.<04e0>Lately things've been a bit more muted... Lady<03e0>Bertrude has been suffering from some strange<03e0>illness, and that's all anyone can talk about.
[[5th level message]]

Looks like the Merchant Lot's gone through a<03e0>fire sale...<04e0>Everything went downhill quick since the<03e0>Conqueror's army marched in here<07f0>and<03e0>marched out with our Remnant, the Tao Tie.

Lady Bertrude, Duchess of Balterossa, once was<03e0>married, but the Duke was killed in an accident<03e0>in the desert, long ago.<04e0>Since then Lady Bertrude has run Balterossa by<03e0>herself.<04e0>Her affection for her daughter, the Lady<03e0>Charlotte, is unmatched... Perhaps as she is<03e0>the only piece of the late Duke left.

Lady Bertrude has fallen deathly ill. The town's<03e0>merchants have traveled far and wide, bringing<03e0>back different medicines to try and cure her.<04e0>But it has been to no avail. Her condition has<03e0>steadily worsened...<04e0>What strange affliction could have struck Lady<03e0>Bertrude down?

A half-year previous, we were suddenly attacked<03e0>by a massive army of beasts.<04e0>The army and the Silver Falcons both scrambled<03e0>to Balterossa's defense.<04e0>But amidst the confusion, the Conqueror<03e0>appeared, and used some mysterious stone to<03e0>steal away the Tao Tie.<04e0>Surrounded by the Conqueror's army, there was<03e0>naught we could do but watch...

Hey...hey. Have you seen the Duchess's<03e0>daughter, Lady Charlotte?<04e0>She's the most beautiful girl in all Balterossa...<03e0>Whenever I see her, I just want to<07f003e0>Urhurr hurr hurr...<04e0>...But, I-I've heard she has a<07f0>a lover...<04e0>What kind of guy is she interested in?

But lately she's been losing weight...<04e0>At this rate, Lady Charlotte will fall sick as<03e0>well<07f0>and without me there to catch her! I-I<03e0>have to do something!!!<04e0>...Is what I was thinking, but for some reason,<03e0>they won't let me into the castle. *sigh*

Those jerks in the Conqueror's army came and<03e0>stole the Tao Tie.<04e0>Ever since, the Duchess, and more importantly,<03e0>Lady Charlotte have been too pained to leave<03e0>the castle at all.<04e0>If only I were there with you, my darling,<03e0>I promise I would erase your fears with my<03e0>healing<07f004e0>A-anyway! So that I can once again enjoy the<03e0>sight of the lovely Lady Charlotte, I'm gonna<03e0>find a new Remnant for Balterossa!<04e0>...Is what I was thinking, but I kinda don't<03e0>have any idea where to start looking... *sigh*

Huh?<03e0>What're you doing here, old lady?
"Old lady"!?<03e0>Excuse you! Who the hell do you think you are?
Huh? ...I guess I mistook you for someone else.<03e0>Totally look the same, though...
You're awfully rude to people you've just met.
S-sorry!
Hmph... I'll let it slide this time. Of course, that's on<03e0>the condition that there's never a second.
Calling someone "old lady" is quite inconsiderate...<03e0>especially when they aren't old!
Hm? You again.
Uh.
You don't look happy to see me.
Uh, n-no, that's not true!<03e0>Say, ol<07f0>O beautiful young maid, what're you doing<03e0>around here?
Training.<03e0>In my family, it's a rite of passage<03e0>to travel the world.
Huh... Sounds pretty tough.<03e0>Take care of yourself, okay?
...Ahh. Thank you.
You're not as inconsiderate as I thought.
You're looking well.
Heya, Ms. Young Maiden.
...Right. So, could you not call me that?<03e0>It sounds ridiculous, to say the least.
Well, it's not like I know your name.
Oh?
...
The name's Emmy.
Nice to meet you for real, finally.<03e0>I'm<07f001e00be00ae0>
Rush Sykes, call you Rush, right?
Wha!? C-can you see into my brain!?
Perhaps! Of course, it wouldn't be very difficult...
Take care, Rush.
What's the purpose of my training?<03e0>Well...a lot of things. But in general,<03e0>training the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.

Glory to the Falcons!<03e0>Hello, Rush.<03e0>What? Is it that rare for a sovani to speak to you?
What are the Silver Falcons?<04e0>...Perhaps the most apt description is that we're a<03e0>group of knights who fight for what we believe.<04e0>It doesn't matter if you don't fully understand.<04e0>There are many others in the organization, but<03e0>not here... Operatives carry out their own missions<03e0>across the continent.<04e0>As commander, I give directions to local operatives<03e0>and they take care of the rest.<04e0>Granted, there are certain inconveniences in<03e0>coordinating large-scale operations.<04e0>However, when necessary, everyone will assemble.<03e0>You've no need to worry.<04e0>Oh, yes.<03e0>If the Falcons are called to act, would you be<03e0>willing to lend us your help?<04e0>Certainly, if it was an action against your beliefs, you<03e0>could refuse, no questions asked. Think about it.
If the Falcons are called to act, would you be<03e0>willing to lend us your help?<03e0>Think about it.
How did the Silver Falcons come to be?<03e0>Mmm... A mitra was the founder...<04e0>This all happened decades ago...<03e0>At the time, I had gone to the mountains above<03e0>the town to view the Tao Tie.<04e0>As you know, sovani are very proud beings.<03e0>Like most of us, I had always kept to myself.<04e0>There was a shabby-looking sellsword who wandered<03e0>the area. Whenever he saw me, he'd call out a hello.<03e0>At the time, I found his familiarity rather impertinent...<04e0>Not too much later, monsters assaulted the town.<03e0>It was terrible timing, as the army had been called<03e0>abroad. Balterossa was thrown into a panic.<04e0>That's when that sellsword appeared. He gathered<03e0>the mercenaries of the town, and led them against<03e0>the monster hordes, saving the town.<04e0>I could not understand his actions. Why would<03e0>he risk his life for a bunch of strangers? What<03e0>was his motive?<04e0>He caught my interest. So I decided to join him.<03e0>He was the first leader of the Silver Falcons.<04e0>...<04e0>This story has run long. Perhaps I will continue<03e0>it later... That's enough for now.
If the Falcons are called to act, I would appreciate<03e0>you lending your help.
The beastmen are tenacious enough that it is<03e0>impossible for the dukedoms to suppress them.<03e0>That is why the Silver Falcons are necessary.<04e0>Hm? Ah yes, I was in the middle of the story...<04e0>That sellsword who saved the town...<03e0>The founder of the Silver Falcons.<03e0>He intrigued me, and so I joined the Falcons.<04e0>At first, I meant just to see what made him<03e0>tick. But after spending enough time with him,<03e0>I began to share his beliefs.<04e0>To protect those who cannot protect themselves,<03e0>wielding a blade as strong and sure as the wings<03e0>of the proud falcon... That became my credo.<04e0>I grew to respect him a great deal. I was curious<03e0>to his thoughts on many different subjects.<04e0>Nevertheless, especially compared to that of a<03e0>sovani, a mitra's lifespan is incredibly short.<03e0>...I had tried to prepare myself. I'd attempted to...<04e0>It came faster than I'd imagined.<04e0>One night when the moon was full, the beastmen<03e0>launched a sneak attack on a small village... He used<03e0>himself as a lure to lead them away, to the cliffs.<04e0>And, there he met his end.<03e0>He died as he lived, selflessly acting for others...<03e0>He stayed true to his beliefs to the end.<04e0>...<04e0>It seems I've said too much.<03e0>You are a strange one...<04e0>Forgive me, but I'd appreciate it if you left me<03e0>alone right now.
Forgive me, but I'd appreciate it if I could be<03e0>alone for a while.
For some reason, fighting alongside all of you<03e0>reminds me of my days with the founder.<04e0>He taught me the value of protecting life...<03e0>That is why when it came time for me to take up<03e0>the mantle of commander, I had no doubts.<04e0>Rush...we are in a time of trial. Power, territory,<03e0>Remnants...it seems like anything can inflame<03e0>tensions to war nowadays.<04e0>If I can reduce casualties by interfering in<03e0>these conflicts, then I will without hesitation...<03e0>even if it means working outside the law.<04e0>...<04e0>Ah, now I see.<03e0>You're a lot like he was, Rush. That must be why<03e0>I find myself chattering on at you so much.<04e0>Heh, intriguing...<03e0>I'll be curious to see where your beliefs take you...<04e0>Feel free for that place to be the Falcons.
Rush, would you join the Silver Falcons?<03e0>Know that you would always be welcomed into<03e0>our ranks.

Hello, dearie. Just look at that.

I can't quite say I've ever<03e0>shaken the habit!<04e0>But recently, it's seemed a little strange. Every<03e0>so often, the Tao Tie seems to lose its shine...<03e0>Like its heart had gone cold.<04e0>Ahh, perhaps it's just the ramblings of an old<03e0>biddy... I hope that's all it is, at least.

What? Do you need something?
Do you need something?
Have you seen Lord David?<04e0>I do not feel comfortable letting him alone.<03e0>If you see him, please tell him I am looking for him.
What a troublemaker...
...
On the surface, it does not seem like this place<03e0>has changed very much...<04e0>That said, it is no place to let Lord David run about<03e0>unsupervised. If you see him, tell him I am looking<03e0>for him.
You haven't seen Lord David?
If it was only going to be stolen anyway, we should<03e0>have taken the Remnant ourselves...<04e0>...No, Lord David would never have stood for it.
Please forget I said anything.
The Remnant Ark...<03e0>Surely there must be a similar Remnant elsewhere<03e0>in the world...
I can think of nothing...
Lord David is as prepared as he can be.<04e0>All I have to do is follow.
Ahh... What a spectacular Remnant.<03e0>It just has a certain impact, doesn't it?<03e0>I feel as if I'd never tire of looking at it...<04e0>However... The pair of them don't seem to get along<03e0>all that well, do they...
Incredible...
...
After learning of Remnants disappearing the world over,<03e0>I'd become a bit wary, but look. This place is the same<03e0>as always...it's a small but appreciated blessing.
Yes, yes.
Then, it's just like Athlum...<04e0>The whole mood of the town is different.
What in the world is going on?
It must exist, somewhere...
Let's continue to search.
Let's finish this...learn the true ending of this tale.
Come and check out the weapons they have!<03e0>Ahh, from blunt to sharp, fancy decorative stuff<03e0>to everyday weapons, I love 'em all!
Heheheheh...
Lady Emma...
Heya, Rush! Check it out<07f0>the Remnant's still alive<03e0>and kicking! So we can't get all down either, right?
We can't lose hope now!
Even the weapons seem kinda pooped out...<03e0>Guess it's 'coz the Remnant's gone...
Geez, even the weapons seem pooped out...
Gah, if I have to think about this Remnant stuff any<03e0>more, my head's gonna explode! You just tell me<03e0>where to go when you've figured it out, okay?
I'm ready to rock whenever!
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>Don't worry<07f0>I'll knock down anybody in our way!
What am I doing?<04e0>Just as it looks, taking a walk. As the Marquis,<03e0>I can't just roam the streets alone in Athlum or<03e0>Celapaleis...<04e0>I'm certain Torgal is having conniptions, but let's<03e0>keep this between us, shall we?
Remember, this is our secret.
It seems the Tao Tie is still untouched...
...
Balterossa as well...<04e0>Then, Athlum is not the only victim...
...
What am I rushing around for?<03e0>To be honest, I was mainly trying not to be recognized...
I hope we're not too late...
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>And we'll return together<07f0>victorious!
The town may look the same as always, but that's<03e0>only at first glance.<04e0>There's plenty of rumbling beneath the surface...<03e0>This is no time to start slacking.
This place is rotten...
They've lost their Remnant as well...<03e0>I suppose it could be just coincidence...<04e0>Certainly seems like a plot, though...
I can't believe someone isn't behind all this...
Hey now, quit playing around and help us search,<03e0>will you?  There's got to be another way to get to<03e0>the Sacred Lands, but we won't find it if you don't look.
Don't worry<07f0>we'll find it.
I'll look after Lord David since she cannot...<03e0>So you'd better do the same for Irina.

Welcome to Café Moondust.
Hey there, didja know? There's a city even past the<03e0>great desert.<04e0>At the southern tip of the world, sitting at the base<03e0>of Mt. Altona is a town of hardy<07f0>if pigheaded<07f0>miners.
What, you want to know what's in the western desert?<04e0>The old adventurers used to say that west of the west<03e0>was a forgotten town. But no one knows if it's true or<03e0>not<07f0>no one's ever come back from there alive.<04e0>Mmm, I wouldn't waste my time worrying about that<03e0>place. I would never allow my daughter to go there,<03e0>either!
Every time I see Zolean in here, he's drinking alone.<03e0>It's weird, because he was in here with the same friend<03e0>for years. Wonder what happened to the other guy?
What is it, son? Are you thinking you want to cross<03e0>the desert?<04e0>The Great Sand Sea's home to monsters you won't find<03e0>anywhere else in the world<07f0>and the rest of the world<03e0>is all the luckier for it!<04e0>If you've really got your heart set on going out there,<03e0>make sure you're amply prepared.
What's the critter sitting outside? That's my<03e0>partner, of course!<04e0>Traveling merchants like us make our way by<03e0>takin' a wide range of goods back and forth<03e0>across the desert.<04e0>It's a harsh trip, but with my faithful companion<03e0>by my side, the journey ain't so bad.<04e0>Whoa, there, pardner, hold yer horses. No<03e0>matter how much you offer, I ain't about to let<03e0>my faithful steed go!
Hey, pardner, didja hear?<04e0>The boss o' this here country's been sick fer a<03e0>long spell, an' ain't any o' the medicines<03e0>helpin' a lick.<04e0>While on the range, I rode into another country,<03e0>an' they were singin' a similar song.<04e0>Reckon this bug is only hittin' royal-types?<03e0>That sure don't sound too likely, though...
...<04e0>.........<04e0>What? Don'tcha know when ta leave a cowpoke<03e0>alone? ...Though I reckon there ain't no more<03e0>use in avoidin' it...<04e0>E'er since the Tao Tie disappeared, Balterossa's<03e0>become a ghost town. The dealers ain't comin'<03e0>through, and my business's gone to the dogs.<04e0>To square old debts, I even had to sell my<03e0>faithful companion...<04e0>*sniffle* If...if I could just see 'im again,<03e0>make sure he's bein' treated right...!

It was the son of Royotia's Marquis, Paris!<04e0>I mean, seriously, that man is fine. And you<03e0>know he's gotta be a passionate and skilled<03e0>lover.<04e0>*sigh* If it were me, there'd be no way I'd let<03e0>a catch like that go!
Have you heard the latest about Lady Charlotte?<04e0>Apparently she got back together with her<03e0>boyfriend, Paris. I guess she rethought letting<03e0>such a hunk get away.<04e0>Oh, and get this<07f0>their feelings for each other<03e0>were so strong that they were able to keep us<03e0>and Royotia from going to war!<04e0>*sigh* I want to hook up with a sensitive<03e0>hottie like that...

When the dust<03e0>cleared, the desert country was destroyed.<04e0>However...the spirits of the warriors from the<03e0>defeated land still lurk within the desert's<03e0>sands, awaiting the perfect time for revenge...<04e0>My great-grandfather first told me that tale<03e0>when I was just a little boy. Man, was I spooked!<03e0>I was always home by dark after that!<04e0>Even now, I don't like to go to the<03e0>bathroom alone... Eheheh.
I really worry for Lady Bertrude... She is deathly<03e0>ill, and getting worse every day.<04e0>For her to go from standing proudly at the head<03e0>of our country to lying in a sickbed... How could<03e0>this happen?<04e0>Or<07f0>could it be...?<04e0>The curse of the felled warriors of the ancient<03e0>desert kingdom...?<04e0>Is it possible there was truth to that story...?<03e0>...Ugh, I don't want to think about it!
A half-year previous, a legion of monsters<03e0>attacked the city. Never in all my years had I<03e0>seen so many beasts at once...<04e0>A Silver Falcon said the monsters had come<03e0>from deep in the desert, where a certain beast<03e0>was summoning them as part of a curse.<04e0>It could call unlimited reinforcements, so the<03e0>battle would be unimaginably fierce.<04e0>Without a doubt, this must be the work of the<03e0>angry spirits left from the ancient kingdom of<03e0>the desert...<04e0>Awaking in this time, they seek revenge by<03e0>sending monsters against the lands of the God<03e0>Emperor...<04e0>Goodness gracious, to think that the legend of<03e0>the Kingdom of Glenys was true...
The Silver Falcons have sworn to protect order<03e0>across the continent. We act without regard for<03e0>borders<07f0>there is only one world, after all.<04e0>We are currently in the middle of an important<03e0>strategy session. Please don't interrupt.
Oh, you again.<03e0>Heard about you from the commander.<04e0>Granted, you don't look like much, but I hear<03e0>you're not too shabby with a sword.<04e0>Next time we have an anti-monster operation,<03e0>join us. Lately, we need all the help we can get.
Hi, Rush!<03e0>Sorry for being so rude before.<04e0>I heard the commander was so impressed by<03e0>you that he decided to join you on your journey.<04e0>All of us Falcons have taken an oath to the<03e0>organization, to protect it and uphold what it<03e0>stands for.<04e0>Tell Commander Caedmon that he doesn't have<03e0>to worry about us! The Falcons will still be here<03e0>when he comes back.
These two twin girls came by earlier, and the<03e0>white-haired one left this key. I don't have<03e0>any use for it, so if you want it, it's yours.
Oh, it's you.<03e0>A space away from the heat and hustle and bustle<03e0>of outside... I like this place.
Ah, you...<04e0>I feel like I've forgotten something important yet again...<03e0>Or perhaps it's just my imagination...
I feel like I've forgotten something very important...<03e0>But perhaps it's just my imagination...
Of late the vision of a strange woman has been<03e0>coming to me...<04e0>A girl with a mischievous smile and long, graceful<03e0>fingers... She draws near and strokes my cheek, and...<04e0>Hahaha... Perhaps the desert heat is going to my head.<04e0>Men who spend all their time at war have no time<03e0>for exploits of a romantic nature, yes?
Of late I've been struck with memories of a woman<03e0>I don't know. Odd...a man who spends his days<03e0>fighting as I do has no time for romance...
Oh, Rush.<03e0>I think I've been able to remember more, vaguely...<04e0>We were together...I and that woman...<03e0>She was brilliant<07f0>bright, uncompromising...<03e0>As intense as the desert sun.<04e0>We were sitting near the water...<03e0>The reflection of her smile sparkled off the surface<03e0>of the river.<04e0>...River? Or perhaps it was a canal?<03e0>Where could all of this have happened?<03e0>Curses, I remember all but the most crucial parts...
Who was that woman?<03e0>Damn, I cannot recall anything...<03e0>I think it was near a canal, but...
Hello, Rush.<03e0>I've decided.<03e0>I'm going to find that woman.<04e0>I haven't regained all of my memories of her, but<03e0>I cannot help but think I must meet with her.<04e0>I thought myself to be someone with no passion in<03e0>life except for the battlefield, but it seems there was<03e0>something<07f0>rather, someone else important to me.<04e0>I still don't even know where to begin my search,<03e0>but I'm sure these memories will come with time.<04e0>So, Rush, I would like to travel with you for a little<03e0>longer. I feel like my travels with you will help me<03e0>regain memories.
Hello, Rush.<03e0>I feel I'm on the verge of remembering a little more.
Good to see you, son.<03e0>I've just been here having a drink with an old friend.
Oho, our fearless leader.<03e0>Has something so dire come up that you need the<03e0>services of this old man?<04e0>When it comes to battle, the experiences of fighters<03e0>like me can be a good reference. Every so often young<03e0>warriors such as yourself come to me for advice.<04e0>But just now I was having a drink with a good friend.<04e0>He and I have been coming to this pub for a long,<03e0>long time. It's long been our spot to have a drink<03e0>after a battle. Next time, why don't you join us?<04e0>Ahh, but you're still young yet, aren't you. That<03e0>Marquis of Athlum would have my head for leading<03e0>you into temptation...ha ha ha.
My friend and I have been coming to this pub for<03e0>a long, long time. We relax here with a drink after<03e0>every battle.
You want to know about my friend?<03e0>Ahh... I suppose this starts what, thirty, forty<03e0>years back? We met on the battlefield.<04e0>We were both fresh recruits, shaking in our scales<03e0>to be in the middle of a real battle... We ended up<03e0>cheering each other on.<04e0>Ever since then, we were comrades in arms...<03e0>and rivals, at times.<04e0>But, you know, it's not like we're getting any younger.<03e0>Nowadays we spend a good deal more time meeting<03e0>in places like this than anything else...ha ha ha.
My friend is an old war buddy of mine. Nowadays<03e0>we spend a good deal more time meeting and drinking<03e0>here than anything else, though.
Heyyy, good timing!<03e0>I was just talking about you.<03e0>Zane, here<07f0>this's Rush!<04e0>Hm?<03e0>Where the devil'd he go? Can't believe he sneaked<03e0>off again...left me with the bill, to boot.<04e0>I swear Zane was right here a minute ago.<03e0>Rgh, he always does this...disappears right when<03e0>I need him. Like that time in Siebenbur...<04e0>Ahh, you know what, I think maybe I've had a li'l<03e0>too much to drink... *hic*
Can't believe Zane just up and disappeared like that...<03e0>Just like in Siebenbur, he just...<03e0>*hic*
What? That's...that's Zane's!<03e0>Ah. Ahh, you found it...<03e0>...<04e0>Three years ago...<03e0>There was a big operation to clean the beastmen<03e0>armies out of Siebenbur.<04e0>Zane was in charge of one of the main squads.<03e0>He knew the beast leader had to be taken down.<03e0>So he went after them...but didn't come back.<04e0>In the end, we beat back the beastmen. I didn't<03e0>hear about Zane until it was all over.<04e0>I couldn't believe it...I wouldn't believe Zane was<03e0>gone until I could see it with my own eyes.<04e0>I thought, if I came here, to the pub we always met<03e0>at, he'd eventually show up... I've been waiting ever<03e0>since.<04e0>I suppose I've been afraid to accept the truth...<04e0>But, seeing that ring, I can't run from reality any longer.<03e0>And...I think that finally, I'm alright with that.<04e0>It seems that even old as I am, I still need to work<03e0>on my discipline. ...Thank you, Rush.<04e0>Any time this old man can be of use, just say the<03e0>word. I'll help in any way I can.
Hello there, young one.<03e0>Any time this old man can be of use, just say the<03e0>word. I'll help in any way I can.
Welcome! Please make yourself at home.
If you touch my daughter you'll be joining<03e0>the Duchess's harem of eunuchs.<03e0>So make yourself comfortable!
Do you know Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis? Rumor has it<03e0>that his wife has run away from him. In fact, the couple<03e0>is infamous for not getting along, so no one is surprised...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
What in the world is the baron doing? The most<03e0>important thing a man can do is take care of<03e0>the home! Darling daughter, you agree, right?
Er, of course!
I don't want to believe it, but the rumor is that there's<03e0>a woman plotting to assassinate Duke Qubine...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Assassination... What a dangerous world this has<03e0>become! Beloved daughter, I think I'll have to<03e0>make your curfew earlier...
I...I see...
Apparently the desert princess has been sneaking out<03e0>of the castle to meet her lover.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Ohh, I completely sympathize with her mother.<03e0>Every parent wants to keep their daughter near.<03e0>Beloved daughter, you'd better stay at home for a while!
I...I see...
The desert princess has eloped!
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Whaaat!? That girl's poor parents! I hope they find<03e0>that beast of a man and hang him for the crime of<03e0>stealing a young girl's innocence!
Daddy, calm down!
Relations between Balterossa and Royotia have really<03e0>gone downhill. Families of soldiers are getting worried<03e0>since the armies are being mobilized...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Ugh, this is all due to that lecherous fiend who stole<03e0>away the princess. What an impressive list of crimes...<03e0>Beloved daughter, I'm sure you agree.
Er, of course!
So there's supposed to be something the Imperator<03e0>sealed out in the great swamp, but now the seal is<03e0>broken. Maybe it's the entrance to another world...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Once one enters another world, most likely they can't<03e0>return. Alright, beloved daughter, don't go to the swamp<03e0>until I say so!
O-okay...
Apparently one of the Forest Maidens bound to<03e0>a knight of the Order of Melphina can sense<03e0>what he's sensing.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Knights sworn to protect maidens... Perhaps I should<03e0>find my beloved daughter a knight as well... No<07f0>this<03e0>is my duty. Daddy will protect you with his life!
Er, thank you.
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina<03e0>are mobilizing... Seems something's happened to<03e0>the Last Leaf in Crookfen.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, seems the swamp has become more and more<03e0>dangerous. I can't have you going near it... Beloved<03e0>daughter, you mustn't leave the town for a while.
A-alright...
It's almost time for Kosmosfest, but apparently<03e0>the Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to Nagapur yet.<03e0>Maybe she got mixed up in something...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Kosmosfest... Beloved daughter, if you are very good,<03e0>then Daddy will take you to see it!
Yay...
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started<03e0>the Kosmosfest alright, but then it was interrupted<03e0>by monsters.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Whaaat!? Monsters at the festival!? No, no, this won't<03e0>do. Too dangerous! Sorry, beloved daughter, but<03e0>Daddy can't put you in that sort of danger.
O-oh...
An old-fashioned lady is looking to hire bodyguards,<03e0>I hear. She's supposed to be hanging out at the pub<03e0>near the canal.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Old-fashioned, hm? Beloved daughter, that is exactly<03e0>the sort of look you should cultivate! Yes, become<03e0>old-fashioned for Daddy, alright?
A-alright...
Do you like antiques?<03e0>Apparently a lot of the treasures of the Old Kingdoms<03e0>are turning up on the black market.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, the black market... My beloved daughter doesn't<03e0>need to be thinking about things like that! Alright,<03e0>forget what you just said, alright, dear?
O-okay...
There's a man looking for three very important stones<03e0>in the desert. Apparently they're very historically<03e0>significant.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
There are many secrets hidden within the desert<03e0>wastes. Beloved daughter, study up on the rich history<03e0>just outside your door!
O-okay...
A man interested in ancient magick is looking for<03e0>people to help out with research. Seems he's on<03e0>the verge of unlocking some huge mysteries.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Magick and mysteries...<03e0>It is an intriguing offer<07f0>I would go and help<07f0>but<03e0>I cannot leave my daughter's side.
Apparently there's a scary monster that was sealed<03e0>by one of the God Emperors, but came back...<03e0>People say the whole world is in danger!
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, the world is in danger... Don't worry, dear.<03e0>Daddy will protect you, even if it costs him his life...
Daddy...
Some amnesiac is wandering around the cities in<03e0>the desert, looking for something that could regain<03e0>his memory.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
To lose all one's memories...how terrible. If my<03e0>beloved daughter were to completely forget me,<03e0>I don't know what I'd do...my life would be over!
Daddy, calm down!
Recently people have been seeing an infamous bandit<03e0>around Athlum. Apparently he's waiting around for<03e0>someone but no one's brave enough to ask who.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
A bandit...not only dangerous, but a man...<03e0>No, no, no, this won't do. I forbid you from even<03e0>getting near Athlum, alright, dear?
O-okay...
There's a goddess statue in the Robelia Ruins that's<03e0>supposed to let you meet anyone in the world.<03e0>Someone who lost his sister is looking for it...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
What an amazing statue!<03e0>Beloved daughter, promise me that if we are ever<03e0>separated you will use that statue to find me.
O-okay...
There's a murderer on the loose in the capital!
That's the latest news, Daddy.
A murderer<07f0>in the capital!? ...Where is this "capital"?<03e0>It...it couldn't be here, is it? That's it, I forbid you to<03e0>take even one step out of the house!
O-oh...
There's a really big yama who needs help searching<03e0>for things... But he's a little...touched, so people have<03e0>been trying to keep out of his way.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Lost items...a pity. But look, honey, if you ever lose<03e0>anything at all, you come tell me first, alright?<03e0>Daddy will find it for you, no matter what.
A-alright...
Some white qsiti's been looking for a magickal book.<03e0>People seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's<03e0>been able to place him.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Magickal tomes... I studied the intricacies of ancient<03e0>magicks when I was young. Beloved daughter, if you<03e0>have interest in the subject, then study it well!
A-alright...
A set of twins have turned up as mercenaries lately,<03e0>really capable ones. Apparently they're really pretty,<03e0>but maybe a little standoffish.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm... I don't want to seem sexist, but mercenaries are<03e0>always putting their life on the line... No, daughter,<03e0>I believe I must forbid you from becoming one!
O-okay...
A man in the Great Sand Sea's been looking for<03e0>challengers for some sort of game. But apparently<03e0>he only wants really special people to play.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Some "game" with some man!? No, oh no.<03e0>That's it, daughter, I forbid you from going to the desert.<03e0>Don't even get close!
A-alright...
Some elderly warrior's been crossing the Great<03e0>Sand Sea, looking for a special sword.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
An elderly man searching for a sword...<03e0>It must hold incredible significance to him.<03e0>You understand, my daughter?
Y-yes...
The guards of Ghor have all sworn to follow their ruler<03e0>for as long as they live.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Mmm... With a guard that dedicated, the ruler must<03e0>certainly be great. Beloved daughter, you may go to<03e0>that town any time.
Y-yay...
There's not a family in the world as dedicated as<03e0>the Honeywells. If you've got them at your back,<03e0>you can do anything.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
The matriarch of the Honeywells is indeed a formidable<03e0>woman. But being a warrior is too dangerous for<03e0>my daughter! I forbid you from becoming one!
A-alright...
Apparently Athlum's General Torgal is supposed to<03e0>have some things in his past that're coming back<03e0>to haunt him, centered in Royotia...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Something from the general's past...hrm.<03e0>Beloved daughter, I forbid you from getting close to<03e0>men with troubled pasts, alright?
O-okay...
The legendary fighting tourney is about to start.<03e0>Anyone with fighting spirit is invited to participate.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Legendary it may be, it's still dangerous. I forbid you<03e0>from watching such violence! ...You weren't thinking<03e0>of participating, were you!?
N-no...
Apparently there's some mystic academy that's been<03e0>training skilled magi for years.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Ohh, how nostalgic! The academy is my alma mater,<03e0>you know. It would be a fine school for you as well,<03e0>beloved daughter.
O-okay...
Athlum's been going through some tough times, and<03e0>people are worried about the new matriarch of<03e0>the Honeywell clan because she's so young.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
It must be tough... To lose her mother, then take up<03e0>a sword all alone... Beloved daughter, when I die, I forbid<03e0>you from becoming a swordswoman!
O-okay...
Recently there's been gossip about Athlum's Marquis's<03e0>love interests...or lack thereof.<03e0>He's never been connected with anybody.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, and he is that age... Alright, beloved daughter,<03e0>I forbid you from going to Athlum for a while!
O-okay...
The old head of the Academy's been seen in pubs<03e0>across the continent lately. I guess anyone would<03e0>want to drown their sorrows after what happened.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
The Academy's former director? Is that a man or<03e0>a woman? If it's a man, I know one pub he won't be<03e0>going to!
O-okay...
Dr. Sykes has been seen going in and out of Athlum<03e0>Castle often lately. Maybe they've made some sort<03e0>of discovery?
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Oh, a new discovery from the famed scientists...<03e0>intriguing. Beloved daughter, shall we take a trip to<03e0>Athlum to see what the fuss is about?
A-alright...
Some unidentified flying object's been spotted<03e0>swooping around Wyrmskeep. Apparently people<03e0>are really frightened.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Unidentified flying object!? No, no, far too dangerous!<03e0>I forbid you from even going close to Nagapur!
O-okay...
Some hot-blooded female warrior is trying to hunt down<03e0>that group causing trouble in Crookfen. But it's against<03e0>her boss's wishes...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
There is nothing wrong with a bit of a tomboy, but if<03e0>she's too hot-blooded, it just leads to trouble...<03e0>Promise me, daughter, that you will never act so rashly!
A-alright...
A monster army has appeared in the Great Sand Sea<03e0>and is threatening Balterossa. They're so powerful...it<03e0>seems like we're in trouble.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Mmm, there is no reason to go to the Great Sand Sea...<03e0>I will make certain I don't have any errands that would<03e0>send you there, beloved daughter.
According to ancient historians, there's something<03e0>dangerous enough to destroy entire cities sealed<03e0>within the volcano...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Inside the volcano... If it were to cause an eruption,<03e0>there would be nowhere to run. Alright, daughter,<03e0>I forbid you from getting close to the volcano!
O-okay...
No one knows anything about what's going on inside<03e0>the volcano... But, the Marquis of Royotia might have<03e0>some ideas.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
It seems the volcano has not ceased being dangerous.<03e0>I know you don't have a reason to go there, but you are<03e0>still forbidden to go to the volcano!
O-okay...
You know there's a town without anyone running it?<03e0>The old ruler's sons are fighting over the seat of power.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Hrm, sounds like a very dangerous place to me.<03e0>Beloved daughter, I forbid you from going to any town<03e0>without a ruler!
O-okay...
When you're out in the desert, you can hear this sad,<03e0>lonely voice crying from beneath the Great Sand Sea.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Cries from the desert floor... That sounds suspicious no<03e0>matter how you slice it! Daughter, even if you go to<03e0>the Great Sand Sea, I forbid you from going beneath it!
O-okay...
A long time ago, there used to be a famed hero that<03e0>lived in the Great Sand Sea.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
A famed hero...a famed male hero!? I don't care how<03e0>long ago it was, I forbid you from going to the Great<03e0>Sand Sea! Don't even get near it!
A-alright...
So I was walking through town and heard a man all<03e0>"you gotta believe me! If you look at the pillars in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea, then...g-g-gra<07f0>!"
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Ho? I have no idea what that means, but it sounds<03e0>suspicious! Beloved daughter, I forbid you from going to<03e0>the Great Sand Sea!
O-okay...
A mad scientist has been wandering around Melphina.<03e0>If you go over there, you probably should stay away,<03e0>he's giving people strange looks.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Playing at research is simply despicable.<03e0>Could the culprit be...a man!? Oh no, that won't do.<03e0>Beloved daughter, I forbid you from going to Melphina!
O-okay...
The cafe out in Baaluk's supposedly infested with<03e0>bugs...they followed the owner all the way from<03e0>the desert.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Even the smallest bug cannot be allowed to go free!<03e0>Beloved daughter, if you see a bug, you call Daddy at<03e0>once, alright? I'll take care of everything!
O-okay...
Nagapur's been increasingly unsafe.<03e0>Recently several youths have gone missing...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Missing youths...missing young women!?<03e0>Beloved daughter, I forbid you from going to Nagapur!<03e0>Do not even take a step in that direction!
A-alright...
Adventurers have gotten into trading the different<03e0>treasures they find on their trips. Royotia's the main<03e0>hub for the fad.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Such an exchange sounds like fun<07f0>but only if the one<03e0>you trade with is trustworthy. ...Beloved daughter, I don't<03e0>think I can allow you to play such a game!
O-okay...
Royotian merchants are getting frustrated with<03e0>Balterossa...they control all of their trade routes.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Irate merchants, huh...<03e0>Beloved daughter, if some merchant tries to pick<03e0>a quarrel with you, call Daddy at once, alright?
A-alright...
Some yamaan mercenary is looking for a partner.<03e0>Could be a good way to make a few G.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Mercenary work has no bearing on a wholesome<03e0>family such as us. Beloved daughter, I forbid you<03e0>from even talking about such a dangerous field!
O-okay...
A man with a double personality has shown up in<03e0>Celapaleis. He'll seem very kind and then suddenly<03e0>start cursing at people...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
A two-faced personality... Beloved daughter, I forbid<03e0>you from befriending someone like that! Take care<03e0>before you get to know someone, alright?
O-okay...
There's a qsiti going to crowded places, standing in<03e0>everyone's way, and then picking fights with people<03e0>who run into him. People are really annoyed...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
How rude! Beloved daughter, I think you should avoid<03e0>crowded places for a while! Yes...I can't have you in<03e0>a place like that!
O-okay...
There's a mysterious woman who seems like she's<03e0>waiting for something very important. She apparently<03e0>looks very worried...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
A woman in distress...<03e0>Beloved daughter, if anything ever troubles you, come<03e0>straight to me. We can bear the burden together.
Daddy...
It seems that the Bloody Alice gang has been gathering<03e0>in Crookfen.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Bloody Alice... I have never heard anything but nasty<03e0>rumors about them. Beloved daughter, I forbid you from<03e0>going to Crookfen!
O-okay...
Seems the Jhana have been reappearing in the<03e0>Great Sand Sea. You wouldn't think they'd have<03e0>forgotten being blasted by the Gae Bolg already...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
The Jhana have never done anything but harm people...<03e0>Yes, the Great Sand Sea is too dangerous. I forbid you<03e0>from going there, beloved daughter!
A-alright...
Recently the Silver Falcons took out a pack of Jhana.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
The Silver Falcons do admirable jobs, but for them,<03e0>fighting is their life... No, too dangerous! I forbid you<03e0>from meeting with them, beloved daughter!
O-okay...
The Silver Falcons have been going after the remnants<03e0>of the Conqueror's army. Who knows what those guys<03e0>could be up to...
That's the latest news, Daddy.
Anyone who could go up against the Conqueror's army<03e0>must be incredibly powerful themselves! Beloved<03e0>daughter, I forbid you from getting close to him!
O-okay...
Some gloomy-looking guy's been hanging around<03e0>the pub in Elysion recently...bumming everyone out.
That's the latest news, Daddy.
A gloomy...man!?<03e0>No, no, too dangerous! Beloved daughter, I forbid<03e0>you from going to Elysion's pub!
O-okay...

Well met, traveler.<03e0>I have heard tales of what you've done.<04e0>I am grateful for your service to Balterossa.<03e0>I look forward to your further exploits.
Welcome, traveler. You have done well to<03e0>make your way through the great desert.<03e0>I am Bertrude di Balterossa.<04e0>I trust you've visited our market?<04e0>I am certain you'll be impressed by the various<03e0>rare items offered for sale there.
Lately it seems my body will not agree to my<03e0>spirit's wishes... It's almost as if some strange<03e0>power tries to control me...<04e0>Th-this wave...could it be...
Forgive me, but I must rest. If your dealings<03e0>can wait, then please return later.
I give my thanks for all that you've done.
However, I will not be revealing the details of<03e0>this plot to the public. I have my own idea of<03e0>the culprit. Now, to spin a web to catch them...
My daughter has made the right choice in<03e0>returning to me. I will not accept her dallying<03e0>with that man.
In the end the incident with Royotia came to a...touching<03e0>conclusion. Certainly, using the two of them required more<03e0>than a little care.<04e0>Nevertheless, in the end it became a good bargaining chip.
You have my thanks for your hard work.<03e0>Without your assistance, Balterossa would truly have<03e0>no future.
Welcome, traveler. You have done well to make your way<03e0>through the great desert.<03e0>I am Bertrude di Balterossa...
Recently my body has felt dull and sluggish...<03e0>Never before have I experienced such fatigue.
I am Charlotte, the heir to Balterossa. It is a<03e0>pleasure to make your acquaintance.<04e0>If you've any questions about this land,<03e0>please do not hesitate to ask.
Mother's face looks so pale and drawn these days...
My mother's illness has lasted for a long time.<03e0>It seems as if there's nothing I can do for her...<04e0>Just waiting and watching while she suffers so<03e0>is too much for me to bear.
I am sorry I've caused Mother such trouble.<03e0>Yet Paris is a wonderful man...
Mother only wants what's best for me. She<03e0>raised me herself... I cannot betray her trust.<03e0>If only he could understand...
Did you hear?<03e0>Mother has allowed Paris and I to court!
I heard it was a terribly harsh battle...<04e0>There are no words to express how thankful I am<03e0>for what you've done.
You stand before the Lady Bertrude!<03e0>Mind your manners.
I'm almost certain I've seen the man Lady<03e0>Charlotte was meeting before... If only I could<03e0>remember where?
Lady Bertrude is quite stoic about it, but this<03e0>business with her daughter really pains her.
Sometimes I believe ignorance really is bliss...<03e0>Especially in things political...
Sir Rush. Well done on the battlefield.
You stand before the Duchess of Balterossa!<03e0>Watch your tongue.
The Duchess was at her wits' end while the<03e0>Lady Charlotte was away.
Thank heavens, the Lady Charlotte has returned<03e0>safely. The Duchess is very relieved.
It seems the Royotian Guard suffered many losses.
I hope to become more like you, Sir Rush.
You are in the presence of Lady Bertrude of<03e0>Balterossa! Mind your manners.
Lady Charlotte often goes to have her fortune<03e0>told. It seems to bring her great happiness.
To think, the Lady Charlotte was exposed to<03e0>such danger... This is a blight to the honor of<03e0>Balterossa.
Sir Paris will be the next Marquis of Royotia.<03e0>I can't begin to imagine the pressure Lady<03e0>Charlotte faces.
It is difficult work, bringing the desert's past to light,<03e0>but I believe a brave and determined youth like<03e0>you could find the whole truth.

rush_sykes_sEu não deveria partir sozinho.<03e0>Melhor retornar e me juntar ao David.
plocterEi, onde pensa que está indo?<03e0>Você precisa ir ao <1be0ffbe34ff>Castelo de Athlum<1ce003e0>para apresentar seu relatório.
pagusPara onde está indo, meu rapaz?<03e0>Você deveria ir primeiro ao <1be0ffbe34ff>Castelo de Athlum<1ce003e0>para relatar suas descobertas.
rush_sykes_sIsso foi perda de tempo. Se soubesse não teria vindo...<03e0>Vou procurar pela Irina por mim mesmo.

emma_honeywell_sEstá planejando deixar o Lorde David<03e0>para trás? Precisamos permanecer juntos!
rush_sykes_sNão
rush_sykes_sNão acho que seja uma boa ir sozinho...<01e00be027e00500>pagusOnde você está indo?<03e0>Devemos permanecer aqui até segunda ordem.

plocterJovem Mestre!<03e0>Há uma espécie de barreira invisível...<03e0>Não podemos seguir adiante!
irina_sykes_sParece que a energia vinda das luzes negras<03e0>está formando a barreira...
david_nassau_sEntão precisamos destruir todas as luzes negras.
irina_sykes_sLorde David!<03e0>Posso sentir a energia das luzes negras!<04e0>Precisamos <1be0ffbe34ff>acabar com elas<1ce0> para entrar em<03e0>Koenigsdorf!
david_nassau_sQue assim seja, homens! Preparem-se para a luta!
david_nassau_sRush, precisamos enfrentar o exército do<03e0>Conquistador nas <1be0ffbe34ff>Planícies Sagradas<1ce0>para entrar em Elysion. Vamos nos apressar.

Wait. Look at this.
Listen when I talk to you.<03e0>You should take a look at this.
What is that?
It's a treasure chest<07f0>a type of Remnant.<03e0>They're not that uncommon.
Remnant, huh...
There could be any number of things inside.<03e0>Find out<07f0>bind it.
Bind? What do you mean?
You have to "bind" a Remnant to use it.<03e0>In this case, just reach out your hand and<03e0>ask it to show you what's inside.<04e0>It's simple enough that even you can do it<07f0>so<03e0>long as someone else hasn't bound it first.
A sword, hm? I suppose you can keep that.<03e0>You won't be quite as useless.
Quiet.
Is that what you were fighting before?
Yes, monsters.<03e0>It looks like we can't avoid them.<03e0>Let's initiate a battle before they spot us.
What are you waiting around for?<03e0>Hurry and initiate a battle.
You're too close! They'll spot you!
Damn, they noticed us.<03e0>I thought I told you to initiate a battle!
Damn, they're too close!
