In a thousand years time,<04e0>My flesh has rotted,<04e0>My memory faded,<04e0>My heart has become hard as stone.
Yet a piece of him remembers me still.
These stones stand as proof of that.<04e0>And with that simple knowledge, I remember the<03e0>feel of him. Warm like morning sun against<03e0>bare skin...<04e0>Having felt that once more, I can rest forever...
Yes...<04e0>As my soul disappears, the curtain can finally<03e0>fall on the Kingdom of Glenys.<04e0>I no longer know the words to thank someone,<03e0>yet thanks I extend.<04e0>To you, who taught me that within him,<03e0>a part of me still lives...
Waa...grrr..........
