Welcome to the Firestone!
So I was digging when I ended up all the way in<03e0>Lavafender. Guess I got carried away... Anyway,<03e0>that's when I see it...<04e0>I swear to Marion this wasn't a mirage<07f0>but I'm<03e0>in this sweltering-hot cave full of lava and I see<03e0>this young girl just standing there, all alone.<04e0>So, of course, I go to her<07f0>I mean, it's<03e0>dangerous, no place for some little slip of a<03e0>girl<07f0>and get this: she disappears.<04e0>Insane, right? I figure she's gotta be a ghost<03e0>with unfinished business. That's the only<03e0>explanation.<04e0>Hey, I toldja it wasn't a mirage! I know what I<03e0>saw!
Apparently Lord Priam's in bad shape.<04e0>It's real hard to believe, though<07f0>he's always<03e0>been healthier than even us miners. He ain't<03e0>the type to get sick, 'specially not bad as this.<04e0>It's damned frustrating... Alls we can do is try<03e0>and dig up some expensive ore, and try and hire<03e0>a healer from abroad.
Right before that Conqueror bastard marched<03e0>into town, this freaky voice like a bird call or<03e0>something was heard all over town.<04e0>For some reason, hearing it made me think of<03e0>that ghost I saw down in Lavafender that one<03e0>time...<04e0>Maybe the whole reason the Conqueror could<03e0>take the Emeth Tag in the first place was<03e0>because of the ghost's curse!<04e0>...Nah, that's crazy talk. I'm just freaking<03e0>myself out...
Long time ago, deep within the earth's molten<03e0>core, twin birds signifying good and evil were<03e0>locked in eternal battle.<04e0>The founder of Royotia saved the bird of virtue.<03e0>In return, he gained weapons strong enough to<03e0>defeat and take over the surrounding lands.<04e0>However, the bird of virtue fought again with<03e0>the bird of evil, and lost. The founder was<03e0>absorbed into the evil beast.<04e0>When all was almost lost, the bird of virtue<03e0>began to sing a lament...a lullaby.<04e0>Upon hearing the sad, gentle song, the bird of<03e0>evil fell asleep and sank beneath the lava, to<03e0>slumber for eternity.<04e0>That legend has been told in this land for<03e0>hundreds of years. Still, there aren't too many<03e0>people interested in such fairytales nowadays.
I heard from Lord Paris that you had defeated<03e0>the bird of evil, Vespalia, once and for all.<04e0>I never would have thought that the legend was<03e0>real...<04e0>The only reason Royotia still stands today is<03e0>due to you. I speak for the entire town when I<03e0>say you have our thanks.
Just before the Conqueror's army marched on<03e0>Royotia, the harsh sound of a bird's call could<03e0>be heard all through the city.<04e0>That legend...it wasn't just a fairytale. The<03e0>bird of virtue's seal has broken. The bird of<03e0>evil has awakened.<04e0>Whether the Conqueror returns here or not,<03e0>Royotia is finished...
Hrmm, ain't nothing interesting goin' on at all.
Do you know Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis? Seems his<03e0>wife's disappeared. Probably left him...it wouldn't be the<03e0>first time. Or the second...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Baron Nielsen...my eternal rival! I'll beat you yet...<03e0>Whenever you realize we have a rivalry, anyway.
Yeah, yeah!
Seems like there's some crazy woman plotting to<03e0>assassinate Duke Qubine...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Duke Qubine...what a disagreeable ruler!<03e0>...I guess. Not like we've met or anything.
Like you ever could!
So, the desert princess has been sneaking out of<03e0>the castle to meet some guy she's been mooning over.<03e0>Sounds kinda dangerous to me...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The desert princess is my biggest fan!<03e0>...I wish, anyway.
Impossible!
Hey!<03e0>So, the desert princess has eloped with her man!
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Eloping...this man is also my rival!<03e0>...If only he knew it.
Not likely!
Relations between Royotia and Balterossa have taken<03e0>a nosedive lately. The families of soldiers are really<03e0>worried that war is unavoidable.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Balterossa...my beloved Royotia will deal you<03e0>a crushing blow! ...Someday.
Keep hope alive!
So there's supposed to be something the Imperator<03e0>sealed out in the great swamp...<03e0>Problem is, the seal's broken...oops!
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Imperator<07f0>another one of my rivals!<03e0>...If he were still alive, that is.
Riiight.
So, one of the Forest Maidens bound to those<03e0>Order of Melphina knights can sense what he's<03e0>sensing.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Forest Maidens...more of my fans!<03e0>...That would be incredible, huh?
Impossible!
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina<03e0>are mobilizing... Seems something's happened to<03e0>the Last Leaf in Crookfen.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Last Leaf...I've never seen it and thus have<03e0>nothing to say about it. Next!
Boo...
It's almost time for Kosmosfest, huh.<03e0>But apparently the Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to<03e0>Nagapur yet. Maybe she got mixed up in something...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Cosmos Maiden...another of my fans!<03e0>...That would be incredible, wouldn't it?
Impossible!
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started<03e0>the Kosmosfest alright. Usually the ceremony's a bunch<03e0>of hooey, but this time it was interrupted by monsters.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Kosmosfest! I've never seen it and thus have<03e0>nothing to say about it. ...Next!
Boo...
Some old-fashioned chick is looking to hire<03e0>bodyguards, I hear. She's supposed to be hanging out<03e0>at the pub near the canal.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Ancient lady<07f0>I'm sure she's a fan of me!<03e0>...Right?
Impossible!
Apparently a lot of the treasures of the Old Kingdoms<03e0>are turning up on the black market.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The treasures of the Old Kingdoms...they were all<03e0>stolen by me! ...Okay, sorry. That's a lie.
Not a funny joke!
Some guy is looking for these three stones that're<03e0>really important to the desert.<03e0>Historically significant, or something.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Three stones...they belong to me!<03e0>...Okay, sorry. That's a lie.
Not a funny joke!

I think you're unforgettable, boss!
Recently people've been seeing this infamous bandit<03e0>around Athlum. Apparently he's waiting around for<03e0>someone but no one's brave enough to ask who.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Infamous bandit...obviously you are my rival!<03e0>...Hey, I'd be a better bandit than you'd think.
...Is that something to be proud of?
There's a goddess statue in the Robelia Ruins that'll<03e0>let you meet anyone in the world, no matter how far.<03e0>Some kid who lost his sister is totally into it...
An' that's the story!

Boo...
There's a murderer on the loose in the capital!
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Murderer...obviously you are my rival!<03e0>...I feel as if I should catch up.

Certainly a rival in the strange department!
Some white qsiti's been looking for a magickal book.<03e0>People seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's<03e0>been able to place him.

Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>White qsiti! You must be another of my rivals!<03e0>...For reasons I cannot quite explain.
If you say so!
There's these twins that've turned up as mercenaries<03e0>lately...good ones, too. The one girl is supposed to be<03e0>a real cool customer<07f0>both in looks, and in attitude.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Twin mercenaries...obviously both are huge fans!<03e0>...Even if they don't quite know it yet.
Impossible!
Some guy out in the Great Sand Sea's been looking<03e0>for challengers for some game. Seems like<03e0>they've gotta be pretty impressive, too.

You don't even know what the game is...

Riiight.
A bunch of guards somewhere have sworn to<03e0>follow their ruler for as long as they live.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Ruler of somewhere...you, too, are my rival!<03e0>...I wonder where that "somewhere" is.
Good question.
There's not a family in the world as dedicated as<03e0>the Honeywells. If you've got them at your back,<03e0>you can do anything.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph! The Honeywells...their<03e0>blood runs through my veins! ...Er, my mother's sister's<03e0>cousin's grandmother's niece's friend!
That's not related to you at all!

An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Honeywell matriarch...obviously she, too, is one<03e0>of my fans! ...At least, that would be nice.
Impossible!
Recently there's been gossip about Athlum's Marquis'<03e0>love interests...or lack thereof. He's never been<03e0>connected with anybody. Wonder if he's a eunuch?
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Marquis of Athlum...you, too, are my rival!<03e0>...Impressive, don't you think?
Definitely a surprise.
The old head of the Academy's been seen in pubs<03e0>across the continent lately. I guess it stands to reason<03e0>she'd want to drown her sorrows after what happened.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The former head of the Academy...you, too, are my<03e0>rival! ...Or should that be my fan?

An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Volcano...I've never seen it and thus have nothing<03e0>to say about it. Next!

An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Inside the volcano! I've never seen it and thus have<03e0>nothing to say about it. Next!

An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Famed hero...you, too, are my rival!<03e0>...If only you were still alive.
Being dead for a couple hundred years does put a<03e0>damper on the rivalry, huh.
So I was walking through town and heard this guy all<03e0>"you gotta believe me! If you look at the pillars in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea, then...g-g-gra<07f0>!"

Boo...
Yeah, so adventurers have started trading the<03e0>different loot they find on their trips. Seems the fad's<03e0>based right here in Royotia!
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Trading loot...I've done that as well!<03e0>...I think.
Don't you know?
Royotian merchants are getting frustrated with<03e0>Balterossa...they control all of their trade routes.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Balterossa...I've never been there.<03e0>...Wonder what it's like.
...Are you serious?
Some yamaan mercenary's out looking for a partner.<03e0>Could be a good way to make a few G.

Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Annoying qsiti...you, too, are my rival!
In being annoying?
Some mysterious lady's been looking for someone<03e0>to help her out. Seems something pretty serious's<03e0>been dropped on her plate.
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>Mysterious lady...obviously, you, too, are my fan!<03e0>...I hope so, anyway!
Impossible!
You've probably seen them if you've been hanging<03e0>around Crookfen, but Bloody Alice has been gathering.<03e0>Looks like something big's going on...
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Ladies of Bloody Alice...obviously, they are all<03e0>my fans!
Riiight.
Seems the Jhana have been popping up in the Great<03e0>Sand Sea. Didn't Athlum just beat them up not too<03e0>long ago?
An' that's the story!
Harumph harumph...harumph!<03e0>The Jhana...I could destroy them all myself!<03e0>...Okay, sorry. That's a lie.
Not a funny joke!
Recently the Silver Falcons took out a pack of Jhana.
An' that's the story!

Makes it not sound like much of a rivalry...
