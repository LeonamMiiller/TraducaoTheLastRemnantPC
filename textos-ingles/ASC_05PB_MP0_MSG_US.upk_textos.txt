Welcome, traveler, to the Warrior's Honor!<03e0>Go on and make yourself comfortable.
Welcome to the Warrior's Honor! ...He-llo, you aren't<03e0>a familiar face. And trust me, I'd remember a...face<03e0>like yours. You must be new to Athlum, hmm?<04e0>So I want you to know, if you have aaany questions<03e0>at all, come straight to me. I can give you a...personal<03e0>tour.<04e0>...<04e0>Whaaat, you're trying to meet Lord David? Well, he<03e0>receives visitors in <1be0ffbe34ff>Athlum Castle<1ce0>, that's further into<03e0>the city. <04e0>That said, it's not like just anyone can walk in and<03e0>get an audience. Of course, for a cutie like you, he<03e0>may make an exception...
Shimmering blond hair framing that well-made face...<03e0>Lord David certainly cuts a striking figure.<04e0>You just can't keep from looking at him...<03e0>I mean, looking up to him...
Welcome back, cutie!<04e0>Some girl's been coming around here lately,<03e0>all mysterious-like. She's quite a stunner, too...<03e0>Can't compare to me, though!
Say, you know <1be0ffbe34ff>Celapaleis<1ce0>, right?<03e0>They're Athlum's sovereign state. They're to<03e0>the northwest, on the tip of the continent.
I head over to Celapaleis from time to time to<03e0>check out their new accessories.<04e0>You should definitely visit, hon. You'd love it.
Oh, hi, hon. Now, I don't want to get you<03e0>all flustered, but those soldiers over there<03e0>are here looking for you...<04e0>You haven't been doing something naughty<03e0>here in Athlum, have you? Aren't you a little<03e0>scamp! You remind me of myself...
What's that face for?<03e0>Knotting your brows like that brings bad luck,<03e0>you know.
Hi, hon. Those guards are looking for you<03e0>again. Something about having a message<03e0>from Lord David...<04e0>Now, my pub serves many of the Athlumian<03e0>Guard, but I'm not fond of soldiers in my<03e0>place on business, so go talk to them, m'kay?
I can't believe it...a message from the<03e0>beautiful Marquis<07f0>for you? Just what is the<03e0>relationship between you two anyway!?<04e0>Ooh! I'm so jealous I could throw a fit!
You're going, aren't you? To Wyrmskeep...to<03e0>Nagapur.<04e0>Duke Hermeien is a cold and ruthless man.<03e0>Watch yourself around him, Rush.<04e0>And, if you run into that Conqueror bastard...<03e0>Get Lady Emma's revenge!
Ah, you're late! I've been waiting for you for<03e0>ages... Lord David's been looking for you, too.<04e0>Seems like Duke Ghor needs him for something...<03e0>Anyhow, you'd better head to the castle.
Ah, I guess now it's Chairman Ghor, huh. He's<03e0>supposed to be quite the manly and valiant<03e0>leader.<04e0>If nothing else, he seems like a good man to<03e0>lead the continent after all that's happened.
Independence... Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?<03e0>If only dear Papa had gotten a chance to hear it...
So, you're going to fight the Conqueror...<03e0>You'd better come back safe, alright, buster?<03e0>If you don't...you'll hear from me!
Oh man, the other night, the bartender got really<03e0>wasted and wandered all the way up to the<03e0>Robelia ruins.<04e0>And then, a guy who looked just like the<03e0>bartender popped out of nowhere and attacked!<03e0>...At least, that's what he says.<04e0>I dunno, he could've just passed out and<03e0>dreamt the whole thing.
East of town is a huge stretch of fields,<03e0>the Yamarn Plain.<04e0>The place has been a battlefield for years and<03e0>years. People've fought everyone from monster<03e0>hordes to the Ghor army.<04e0>Seriously, if an average Joe like me were to<03e0>even step into that place, I'd be coming back<03e0>in a pine box!
Celapaleis? Ah, that's the big city a ways to<03e0>the north. It's Athlum's sovereign capital.<04e0>Thanks to them, our army can't even jump<03e0>without having to ask that Qubine kid how high.
You been to the Town Square yet?<04e0>It's a shocker, isn't it? The Valeria Heart's<03e0>gone, like it was never there in the first place!<04e0>That Remnant was more than just the symbol of<03e0>the town. The whole square is a place of<03e0>countless memories for every Athlumian...<04e0>Dammit. Bartender, mix me up something<03e0>strong, would you?
That new chairman of the Congress, Ghor, he's the<03e0>one that lives in that run-down fortress, eh?<04e0>When he came into office, I figured he was all brawn<03e0>and no brains, but he's done quite the job of getting<03e0>things under control.<04e0>And now, he's even sending folks to find us all new<03e0>Remnants? That's a good sort if I've ever seen one!
Apparently it was the Duke of Ghor who suggested to<03e0>Qubine that Athlum was ready for independence.<04e0>Even folks like us who used to be enemies, he sees 'em<03e0>at their true worth... That is a real man there, that Ghor.
We'll definitely beat the Conqueror. I believe it so<03e0>strongly that I'm gonna sit right here and have another<03e0>pint.
"In a time rocked by peril, even the earth itself<03e0>trembled from its ferocity, until one day all evil<03e0>was stilled by a giant blade, thrust by the gods..."<04e0>That's the legend of the Valeria Heart. When I<03e0>was young, my father would tell me the story<03e0>over and over.<04e0>But he usually followed it up with something like<03e0>"you'd better be good, or the Valeria Heart's<03e0>gonna get you."
That story about the Valeria Heart was just a<03e0>bunch of bull!<04e0>The Conqueror... He did so many bad things<07f0>he<03e0>even killed Lady Emma<07f0>where's the punishment<03e0>for that, huh?<04e0>And I believed in the Valeria Heart! I really did,<03e0>after all this time... Dammit!
Athlum's independence...? Don't get me wrong, it's not<03e0>like I'm trying to rain on everybody's parade, but... I<03e0>dunno. I just can't seem to get into it right now.
This time...this time the Conqueror is going to pay for<03e0>what he's done! And we can finally find out the truth<03e0>about the Valeria Heart!
Seems like they've started rebuilding the Numor Mines.<03e0>They've still gotta clean out the monsters what live<03e0>there, so it'll be a bit before the grand re-opening.<04e0>It'll be pretty rough not to be able to freely harvest<03e0>there anymore... I heard they've finally got the lift<03e0>working to the lowest level, though.<04e0>If ever there was a time to hit the mines, this is it.
Me?<03e0>I'm the monster slayer.<04e0>Whaddya need?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Tell me about monsters.<09e008e0010000000000>Nothing! Happy hunting.
Alright, mate.<03e0>You've got the time to sit for a spell?<04e0>Can't rush monsters, yanno!<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm not busy.<09e008e0010000000000>Oh, okay. Later, then.
Ahh, that's too bad.<03e0>Well, come back when you have time.
Alright then!<03e0>Here we go.
Well, when you meet with a monster, take a good long<03e0>look at them. If you really take a minute, you can tell<03e0>if they're ready to rumble or not.
Keep your distance, though; if you can check it out<03e0>without it seeing you, that's best.<03e0>That's a hunter trick, eh?
Next is the battle! Now, when you pick a fight with<03e0>a monster, you gotta be careful<07f0>you could end up<03e0>fighting him and his buddies, to boot.
If you're hunting for sport, that's a horse of a different<03e0>color. If you want rewards, you'll want to take on as<03e0>many monsters at once as you can.<04e0>But don't play around, doing any funny stuff when they<03e0>get close. Even if they look calm, you never know<03e0>what a beast's gonna do, eh?
Remember, practice makes perfect. Have some<03e0>confidence in yourself and you'll do fine.
Me?<03e0>I'm the monster sla<07f0>eh?<03e0>Ah, you again.<04e0>I guess you wanna know about monsters, eh?<03e0>It's a long talk, though, you have time this time?<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'm all yours.<09e008e0010000000000>Ahh, sorry, gotta run.
Well...that's enough for now, hmm? Any more and you'll<03e0>be putting me out of a job! The rest you'll just have to<03e0>figure out for yourself. Happy hunting!
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...<04e0>You there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah...why?<09e008e0010000000000>You're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
*snort* Playing dumb won't get you anywhere<07f0>if you're<03e0>playing at all.<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...<04e0>You're Rush Sykes, right?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup, I'm Rush!<09e008e0010000000000>Nope, I'm, uh, someone else.
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.<04e0>He says he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>information-gathering, and that you should come to<03e0>the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> for details.<04e0>Got it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,<03e0>though<07f0>you're not in trouble...not with us at least.<03e0>Lord David's put out a summons for you.<04e0>Apparently he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>your information-gathering, so he'd like you to come<03e0>to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> so he can share it with you.<04e0>Don't make him wait too long, okay, kid? Or else you<03e0>might end up in trouble with us after all... Just joking!
Ohh! That valiant form...<04e0>You must be Rush Sykes, are you not?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The one and only!<09e008e0010000000000>Depends on who's asking.
Well met!<03e0>David, Marquis of Athlum requests that you come<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Athlum Castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!<03e0>I bring a message from Lord David. He requests that<03e0>you come to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Oh, you.<04e0>The only reason I even agreed to travel with<03e0>you is for the money. If you want to get all chatty,<03e0>find someone else. Quit wasting my time.
You again?<03e0>What part of "don't talk to me" don't you understand?<04e0>I know you just think I'm some money-grubbing<03e0>bitch, and to be frank, I couldn't care less. The only<03e0>things I care about are shiny and gold.<04e0>Why?<03e0>I don't think that's any of your business. If you really<03e0>want to know...it'll cost you.
Do I need a sign saying "Get freaking lost"?<03e0>Look, I don't want to talk. I want to make money.<03e0>If you aren't helping me with the latter, piss off.
How long are you planning on sitting around like this?<03e0>I haven't got the time to be lolling around drooling on<03e0>myself like you.<04e0>There's gotta be some job we can take... Patrol duty,<03e0>monster hunting, even a blorging fetch quest... Throw me<03e0>a bone here!<04e0>Urgh, I'm sure the Ladies're scrambling for cash even<03e0>as we speak... They understand the concept of needing<03e0>a place to live and food to eat...<04e0>I can't understand you people at all.
Seriously, you're still sitting around here slacking off?<03e0>I don't care if you're lazy, time is money, and I can't<03e0>waste either. Can we get back to work, please?
Am I tired?<03e0>From this shit? Don't make me laugh.<04e0>Try living hand-to-mouth, always on the run, never able<03e0>to stop even a minute without having to check over your<03e0>shoulder for<07f004e0>...Never mind.<03e0>Could you<07f0>could you not mention I said anything like<03e0>this? Damn, I guess I really am tired...<04e0>Hey, kid...<03e0>Your name's "Sykes," right? So your parents're the<03e0>same as those famous researchers, yeah?<04e0>They ever tell you anything about some shady secret<03e0>projects going on at the Academy?<04e0>...<04e0>Bah, one look at your face and I can tell you don't know<03e0>a thing. Whatever, don't waste your two brain cells<03e0>worrying about it.<04e0>I've got a headache...<03e0>Let me alone for a bit.
Look.<03e0>Please, leave me alone for a bit.
Rush...you again.<04e0>Alright, you wanna talk? Let's chat.<03e0>But if I'm gonna talk, you'd damned well better listen.<04e0>Let me tell you about the Ladies of Bloody Alice...<03e0>We started out attached to the Academy's Third<03e0>Committee.<04e0>As you probably know, they do the research too dirty<03e0>for the other scientists... We handled a lot of their<03e0>testing for them.<04e0>Heh, "testing" sounds so neat and clean compared to<03e0>some of the shit we did... Of course, we didn't object<03e0>at the time. We "Ladies" were far from ladylike.<04e0>More like some of the roughest bitches you'd ever<03e0>meet. Some of us even thought we were lucky to get<03e0>such a sweet gig. But...eventually, our luck ran out.<04e0>One day we found ourselves as the subjects in their<03e0>latest tests<07f0>tests to fuse a person with a Remnant...<04e0>So now I gotta eat like some bottomless pit, 'cause<03e0>if I don't have several times the normal nutritional<03e0>requirements for a mitra, I'll die.<04e0>Pathetic, huh.<04e0>...<04e0>The hell're you looking like that for? If I wanted your<03e0>pity I'd have made up some sob story about losing<03e0>my goldfish or some shit.<04e0>Just...<03e0>I just felt like telling you is all.<04e0>What's done is done. No use wallowing in it.<03e0>Better to live life while you can.
Hey, kid.<04e0>Where're we off to next?<03e0>Make sure it pays well, eh?
Nothing much has been going on lately...
You know Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis? Seems his<03e0>wife's disappeared. ...'Course, those two are famous<03e0>for not getting along, so it's nothing new.
...That's the story, anyway.
What a shameful excuse for a wife!<03e0>You know, I'D know how to properly take care<03e0>of a man...
I don't want to believe it, but it seems like there's<03e0>some crazy woman plotting to assassinate<03e0>Duke Qubine...
...That's the story, anyway.
Poor Lord Qubine...he is too adorable to have to<03e0>deal with such ridiculous things!
So, the desert princess has been sneaking away<03e0>pretty regularly to meet some guy she's been<03e0>mooning over. But sounds kinda dangerous to me...
...That's the story, anyway.
I know, right? Anyone could take advantage of<03e0>a sheltered little princess like that... I hope she<03e0>doesn't get mixed up in anything bad!
Hey!<03e0>So, the desert princess has eloped with her man!
...That's the story, anyway.
Aughhh... That Lord Paris is absolutely fine. I was<03e0>certain he was on our team... *sigh*
Seems relations between Balterossa and Royotia have<03e0>taken a nosedive. All the families of the soldiers are<03e0>getting worried since the armies are being mobilized...
...That's the story, anyway.
Augh, what a crisis! War isn't going to fix anything.<03e0>And if Paris's face were to be scarred or something<07f003e0>Ooh, I'm getting verklempt just thinking about it!
I know, right?
So there's supposed to be something the Imperator<03e0>sealed out in the great swamp... Problem is, the seal's<03e0>broken. Could be the entrance to some other world...
...That's the story, anyway.
Everyone has things in their past they'd like to<03e0>seal away. I can't even count how many things<03e0>I'd like to forget...
There's a Forest Maiden who's so attuned to the Knight<03e0>she's bound to, she can like, see through his eyes or<03e0>hear things he's heard, or something like that.
...That's the story, anyway.
I've got the soul of a pure, innocent young maid too,<03e0>you know. Born again, anyway.
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina<03e0>are mobilizing... Seems something's happened to<03e0>the Last Leaf in Crookfen.
...That's the story, anyway.
I wonder what's going on.<03e0>I know, let's go check it out!
Wh-what about the pub?
It's almost time for Kosmosfest, huh. But apparently<03e0>the Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to Nagapur yet.<03e0>Maybe she got mixed up in something...
...That's the story, anyway.
Well! You simply cannot have a Kosmosfest without<03e0>a Cosmos Maiden! Noble spirit I am, I volunteer myself<03e0>to take her place! ...It'll cost them, though.
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started<03e0>the Kosmosfest alright. Usually the ceremony's a bunch<03e0>of hooey, but this time it was interrupted by monsters.
...That's the story, anyway.
I've heard the Kosmosfest is just so romantic...like<03e0>something out of an old story.<03e0>...Ahhh, I want to gooo!
Some old-fashioned chick is looking to hire bodyguards,<03e0>I hear. She's supposed to be hanging out at the pub<03e0>near the canal.
...That's the story, anyway.
What's she doing that needs that much protection?<03e0>I mean, you don't see me surrounding myself with<03e0>brawny beefcakes... Not for money, anyway.
You're not into antiques, are you? Apparently a lot of the<03e0>treasures of the Old Kingdoms are turning up on the black<03e0>market.
...That's the story, anyway.
Someone's stealing treasures? You can't possibly mean<03e0>that someone could be coming for my precious!<03e0>I'll never allow it to be on the black market!
I'm sure yours will be exempt.
Some guy is looking for these three stones that're<03e0>really important to the desert. Historically significant,<03e0>or something.
...That's the story, anyway.
Rocks, pfft. I'm looking for three wonderful men!<03e0>That's something that would be really important to<03e0>the entire world...or at least the me-part of it.
Some guy into ancient magick is looking for people<03e0>to help out with research. Seems he's on the verge<03e0>of unlocking some huge mysteries.
...That's the story, anyway.
Ancient magick, hm? This guy must be a real brainiac.<03e0>Maybe I'll volunteer...there's something to be said for a<03e0>man who knows what he's doing.
So some folks are crying it's the end of the world<03e0>over some freaky monster. Apparently it was sealed<03e0>by the Imperator, and now it's back...
...That's the story, anyway.
All the more reason to spread love while we can, hm?
Some amnesiac is wandering around the cities in<03e0>the desert, looking for something that could regain<03e0>his memory.
...That's the story, anyway.
How mysterious! I wonder what sorts of exciting<03e0>exploits he could have forgotten. Interest piqued~
Recently people've been seeing this infamous bandit<03e0>around Athlum. Apparently he's waiting around for<03e0>someone but no one's brave enough to ask who.
...That's the story, anyway.
Eek! No question, he's waiting for me! When I said<03e0>I wanted a big strong man to take me away, I didn't<03e0>mean like this...
For you...?<03e0>I guess stranger things have happened.
There's a statue in the Robelia Ruins that's supposed<03e0>to let you meet anyone in the world, no matter how<03e0>far. Some kid looking for his sister wants it...
...That's the story, anyway.
How amazing! It's like something out of a storybook.<03e0>Ahh, what I could do with a statue like that...
(Who does he want to...<03e0>Nah, I don't even want to know.)
Some strange<07f0>thing has been terrorizing Celapaleis.<03e0>It's totally freaking out the people there.
...That's the story, anyway.
Oh, I'm sure the poor thing is just lonely. It just needs<03e0>a friend, and maybe a big hug.
There's a murderer on the loose in the capital!
...That's the story, anyway.
That is simply terrible! I certainly hope they find the<03e0>killer and bring him to justice soon! Ooh, and all<03e0>my favorite boutiques are there...
Augh, don't scrape your nails on the dishes!
There's some massive yama who needs help looking<03e0>for stuff... But he's kinda, uh, weird, so people've<03e0>been trying to keep out of his way.
...That's the story, anyway.
I'm looking for something, too... The perfect partner.<03e0>Experience is preferred, but trainees are welcome...
Some white qsiti's been looking for a magickal book.<03e0>People seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's<03e0>been able to place him.
...That's the story, anyway.
A white qsiti? That's pretty rare. If I got him to work<03e0>here, I bet we'd get loads more customers.
It's a bar, not a sideshow...
There's this set of twins that've turned up as<03e0>mercenaries lately...good ones, too. One is supposed to<03e0>be a real cool customer<07f0>both in looks, and in attitude.
...That's the story, anyway.
Hmph. If you ask me, better to be hot than cool.
Some guy out in the Great Sand Sea's been looking<03e0>for challengers. But he's not interested in Joe<03e0>Schmoes off the street.
...That's the story, anyway.
Mmm, dangerous men are so intriguing! I bet we could<03e0>go head-to-head in a few different "challenges"...
Some old warrior's been crossing the Great Sand<03e0>Sea, looking for a special sword.
...That's the story, anyway.
Spend that much time in the desert and you'll end up<03e0>with skin like old leather! Ugh, there's no way I'd do<03e0>that, not for all the moisturizer in the world!
The guards of Ghor have all sworn to follow their<03e0>ruler for as long as they live.
...That's the story, anyway.
Everyone says the Duke of Ghor is a brave and<03e0>honorable man. Maybe I should drop everything and<03e0>follow him for as long as I live, too...
What about staying faithful to this pub!?
There's not a family in the world as dedicated as<03e0>the Honeywells. If you've got them at your back,<03e0>you can do anything.
...That's the story, anyway.
I certainly believe that! I completely respect Lady<03e0>Emma. With her to look up to, Athlum's girls should be<03e0>stronger and more beautiful than anywhere else.
Yeah! I look up to her too.
So, this gossip is pretty juicy... Apparently General<03e0>Torgal is supposed to have figures from his past<03e0>popping up in Royotia...
...That's the story, anyway.
That poor thing. Now, this is just between us girls,<03e0>but I completely feel the general's pain of having<03e0>an estranged little brother...
Your brother came in here yesterday!
It's about time for the Tournament of Heroes to<03e0>start up again. It's pretty well-known among the types<03e0>with fighting spirit.
...That's the story, anyway.
There's something about wild, feral men locked in<03e0>battle, struggling for domination, muscles straining and<03e0>gleaming with sweat... Ooh, I should get my tickets!
Apparently there's some mystic academy that's<03e0>been spitting out skilled magi for years.
...That's the story, anyway.
Brains are an important part of a good man! That's<03e0>why they're so hard to find...
Athlum's been going through some tough times, and<03e0>people are worried about the new matriarch of the<03e0>Honeywell clan because she's so young.
...That's the story, anyway.
She'll be just fine. She's like a carbon copy of the<03e0>Lady Emma at that age.
Yeah! I don't think we'll have to worry either!
Recently there's been gossip about Lord David's love<03e0>interests...or lack thereof. He's never been connected<03e0>with anybody.
...That's the story, anyway.
Of course! Lord David is concentrating on the<03e0>important things of running a country. ...Plus, he's<03e0>saving himself for me. Sorry, ladies!
The old head of the Academy's been seen in pubs<03e0>across the continent lately. I guess it makes sense<03e0>she'd want to drown her sorrows after what happened.
...That's the story, anyway.
Drinking to forget... Does she really believe this<03e0>will make things better?
Dr. Sykes has been seen going in and out of the<03e0>castle a lot lately. Guess there's been a breakthrough?
...That's the story, anyway.
Dr. John Sykes... He's definitely got the brains, but<03e0>somehow he's got this rugged charm that's<03e0>irresistible... Eh, Marina Sykes? Who's that?
Some unidentified flying object's been spotted<03e0>swooping around Wyrmskeep. It's totally been<03e0>freaking everyone out...
...That's the story, anyway.
Augh! Does that mean that last time I went to<03e0>Nagapur to pick up a few things, that<07f0>thing<03e0>could've been slavering over me!?
You do always say you want to pick up more<03e0>attention...
Some hot-blooded female warrior is trying to hunt<03e0>down that group causing trouble in Crookfen. But<03e0>it's against her boss's wishes...
...That's the story, anyway.
I was quite the hot-blooded warrior in my youth, too.<03e0>Oh, the adventures I had... I could tell you the story,<03e0>but it'd be morning before I was even halfway through.
H-how long is this story supposed to be!?
Some monster army's appeared in the Great Sand<03e0>Sea. They're so powerful that everyone in Balterossa<03e0>is totally in despair...
...That's the story, anyway.
Only those who've known despair know the true<03e0>meaning of hope... So, everyone should have the<03e0>chance to taste despair at least once!
Yeah, well, this could be their first and last chance!
According to ancient historians, there's something<03e0>dangerous enough to destroy entire cities sealed<03e0>within the volcano...
...That's the story, anyway.
Pish tosh. My love for Lord David is enough to rock<03e0>the whole city of Athlum!
Hey, I'm trying to be serious here!
No one knows what's going on inside the volcano,<03e0>and no one knows how to find out... But, the Marquis<03e0>of Royotia might have some ideas...
...That's the story, anyway.
He's the one with the magnificent mustache, right?<03e0>Any man that takes such incredible care of his<03e0>facial hair has got to know a secret or two.
Huh, never figured you for a bear chaser.
You know there's a town without anyone running<03e0>it? The old ruler's sons are fighting over the seat<03e0>of power.
...That's the story, anyway.
Don't talk to me about bloodthirsty succession<03e0>struggles! I fought long and hard to get this pub...
Are...are you serious!?
When you're out in the desert, you can hear this sad,<03e0>lonely voice crying from beneath the Great Sand Sea.
...That's the story, anyway.
You poor dear... Everyone's experienced loneliness.<03e0>You're not the only one who's ever felt like crying...
N-no, that's not what I meant...
A long time ago, there used to be a famed hero<03e0>that lived in the Great Sand Sea.
...That's the story, anyway.
Anyone that famous had to have been a simply<03e0>amazing man... If only I were born a few hundred<03e0>years earlier! *sigh*
So I was walking through the Town Square and heard<03e0>this guy all "you gotta believe me! If you look at the<03e0>pillars in the Great Sand Sea, then...g-g-gra<07f0>!"
...That's the story, anyway.
"G-g-granny," he says!? How rude! I'm not even<03e0>close to hitting my prime, that cheeky little<07f0>ooh!
Some crackpot old scientist has been wandering<03e0>around Melphina. If you go over there, you probably<03e0>should stay away, he's giving people strange looks.
...That's the story, anyway.
Hmm? What sort of looks, I wonder? If it's the look<03e0>of a wounded heart, then he should come here and<03e0>recover in our healing, friendly atmosphere!
Sure<07f0>so long as he pays for his food and drink<03e0>afterwards!
The cafe out in Baaluk's supposedly infested with<03e0>bugs...they followed the owner all the way from the<03e0>desert.
...That's the story, anyway.
Ew, ew, ew! Ugh, I hate bugs!
I'm pretty sure they aren't too fond of you, either...
Nagapur's been increasingly unsafe. Recently a bunch<03e0>of kids have gone missing...
...That's the story, anyway.
Good gracious! Could it be kidnapping? I had better<03e0>be careful as well.
Adventurers have gotten into trading the different<03e0>loot they find on their trips, apparently. Royotia's<03e0>the main hub for the fad.
...That's the story, anyway.
How sad. My greatest treasures are the secret<03e0>feelings bottled within my heaving bosom. But I<03e0>wouldn't trade them for anything in the world!
...Right.
Royotian merchants are getting frustrated with<03e0>Balterossa...they control all of their trade routes.
...That's the story, anyway.
Yes, Royotian jewels are incredibly expensive. I'd<03e0>really love to pick some up, but I just don't have the<03e0>money. Maybe if I gave my staff a pay cut...
Wh-what!? No way!
Some yama mercenary's out looking for a partner.<03e0>Could be a good way to make a few G.
...That's the story, anyway.
Ooh, that must be him over there, no? What a strong,<03e0>strapping man... Mm, if I were you, hon, I'd definitely<03e0>partner up with him.
Some guy with a hot-and-cold personality's shown up<03e0>in Celapaleis. He'll seem really nice and then<03e0>start cursing people out at the drop of a hat.
...That's the story, anyway.
Mmm, for some reason I always feel drawn to<03e0>bipolar men like that. I guess they just spark my<03e0>maternal instincts...
"Maternal"...?
There's some qsiti going to crowded places and<03e0>standing in everyone's way, and then picking fights<03e0>with people who run into him. What an annoyance...
...That's the story, anyway.
Oh! I've run into that guy before...literally. If he ever<03e0>comes in here, the only thing I'm serving him is a<03e0>knuckle sandwich!
So, apparently there's some mysterious lady looking<03e0>for someone to help her with something. She seemed<03e0>to have something important to ask.
...That's the story, anyway.
I also have something to ask...
What?
I told you about the mysterious woman from before,<03e0>right? Seems she's still waiting for something really<03e0>important. I hear she looks super worried...
...That's the story, anyway.
I'm waiting for something really important, too...<03e0>Or someone...
You're just waiting for anyone at all.
You've probably seen them if you've been hanging<03e0>around Crookfen, but Bloody Alice has been gathering.<03e0>Looks like something big's going on...
...That's the story, anyway.
I wanted to join them once...Bloody Alice. Of course,<03e0>back then I was a bit of a rebel, going against the<03e0>grain and all that.
I wouldn't say you're quite going with the grain now...
Seems the Jhana have been popping up in the Great<03e0>Sand Sea. You wouldn't think they'd have forgotten<03e0>being blasted by the Gae Bolg already...
...That's the story, anyway.
Well... Once you quit trying, your life is over. How's<03e0>it different for beastmen? If you've got a goal, keep<03e0>trying until you reach it!
That's great, but not when the goal is destroying<03e0>the city!
Recently the Silver Falcons took out a pack of Jhana.
...That's the story, anyway.
You know, I'm a member of the official Silver Falcons<03e0>fan club! Their sovani leader is so stoic and manly...
The Silver Falcons have been going after the<03e0>leftovers of the Conqueror's army. Who knows<03e0>what those guys could be up to...
...That's the story, anyway.
Good luck, Falcons! Perhaps to help out, I'll go take<03e0>a refreshing drink to that delicious commander.
B-but who's gonna run the pub?
Some gloomy-looking guy's been hanging around the<03e0>pub in Elysion recently, and bumming everyone out.
...That's the story, anyway.
For some reason, I just find myself drawn to dark<03e0>and brooding men... I just want to uncover all their<03e0>mysteries, lay them bare before me...
You kinda find yourself drawn to everyone...
