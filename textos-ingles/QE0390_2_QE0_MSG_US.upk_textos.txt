These are the guardians of Marshallton:<03e0>Namul Sin and Niram Sin.
They continue to protect the tablet held in this<03e0>town, as they have for generations.<04e0>In other words, we'll have to defeat them if<03e0>we're to take the tablet.<04e0>Rather, you will. I can't interfere this time. This<03e0>is something you have to do yourself, Rush.<04e0>Go, Rush. Face this challenge with honor...<03e0>Show me the young man you've become.
With this tablet, you may change a Remnant to a<03e0>talisman, just as you have now.<04e0>Of course, you can only use the tablet on a Blank<03e0>Remnant<07f0>one that's unbound.<04e0>I really didn't want to take the tablet from this place...<03e0>But with things as they are, there's no other choice.
Rush... The future of the world's Remnants<07f0>maybe of<03e0>the whole world<07f0>could come down to you and your<03e0>actions. I'll be praying for your success.<04e0>...Despite that heavy speech, don't overdo it,<03e0>alright? Just...be sure to come back to me in<03e0>one piece, understood?
