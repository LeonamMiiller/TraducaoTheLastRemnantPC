Welcome to the Babbling Brook.
Do you know the Forest Maiden Leticia?<03e0>She's as beautiful and delicate as a flower.<04e0>If only I could be her knight! I'd protect her for<03e0>as long as I live!<04e0>I would do anything to be able to talk to her.
I had no idea that Neo had already claimed Leticia as<03e0>his maiden...<04e0>I joined the Order with Neo and I got to know him well.<03e0>He's a brave man with decent fighting skills.<04e0>But...I'm much better-looking! And if you're talking<03e0>muscles...there's no comparison, I totally blow him<03e0>away. I just can't understand it...<04e0>...Just...just leave me alone.
You made such a valiant effort in the great battle on<03e0>the Malbourge Flatlands!<04e0>I was there, too. You really impressed me with the way<03e0>you were handling your sword.<04e0>Neo and Leticia?<03e0>Oh, I'm over that.<04e0>Watching you on the battlefield, I realized that I don't<03e0>need a woman<07f0>just being a strong warrior is<03e0>rewarding enough.<04e0>Thanks for cheering me up!
I train every day to become a great knight.<03e0>I have yet to find the maiden for me, though.<04e0>I wonder if I'll ever find her...
I was just in Cobalt Plaza, praying to the Blue Elf<03e0>for Meister Olebeag's quick recovery.<04e0>That's when I found my soul mate!<04e0>She had very beautiful eyes, filled with sincerity.<03e0>I haven't told her how I feel yet.<04e0>I hope that someday we can devote our lives to<03e0>each other and protect this town together.
With the loss of the Blue Elf, people are worried about<03e0>the town's future. I went to the guild today to see if I<03e0>could help out somehow...<04e0>That's when I found my soul mate!<04e0>She had very beautiful eyes and was absolutely radiant!<03e0>Of course, I haven't actually spoken to her yet...<04e0>But I hope that someday we can devote our lives to<03e0>each other and protect this town together.
Have you seen a white qsiti around these parts?<03e0>He was the leader and sole survivor of the brigade<03e0>that was eradicated in the Catacombs.<04e0>Lord knows where he is now.<03e0>I pray he's not up to anything foolish.
Hmph.<04e0>I have no time for you.
I hear you're the leader of this troupe.<04e0>Has it come down to this?<03e0>I, Leucetius, taking orders from a mitra child?<04e0>I volunteered only upon hearing of help needed<03e0>by Athlum's special forces.<03e0>I have no time for childish games.<04e0>I will show you who is a worthy leader, after I<03e0>"negotiate" with the generals.
I have nothing to say to you.
Th-that yama...<03e0>His strength...<04e0>...<04e0>Don't look at me like that.<03e0>I threw the match to allow him<03e0>to save face.<04e0>He's no worthy opponent of mine.<03e0>The other generals should make for<03e0>better opponents.
Leave me alone.
Th-that mitra...<03e0>Her flawless sword technique...<04e0>...<04e0>Don't look at me like that.<03e0>I threw the match.<03e0>I would never hurt a lady.<04e0>I need to go up against someone of higher<03e0>rank than the generals to get myself heard.
Go away. Now.
I-I can't stop shaking...<03e0>His intimidation is overwhelming...<04e0>...<04e0>...Rush, you know the marquis well,<03e0>don't you?<04e0>Then tell me this.<03e0>When he...his lord...glared at me, I couldn't<03e0>stop shaking.<04e0>How does a mitra who hasn't been around<03e0>for 20 years make others tremble in fear?<04e0>Is it a trait of a marquis?<03e0>Or perhaps something acquired by being<03e0>the owner of the extraordinary Gae Bolg?<04e0>...Whatever the case, Rush, I owe you<03e0>an apology. You are a worthy leader if<03e0>you can control such mighty warriors.<04e0>If you ever need a hand, don't<03e0>hesitate to ask.
Have you come to me for help?<04e0>Don't be shy.
