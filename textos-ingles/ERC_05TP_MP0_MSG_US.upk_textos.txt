Once Lady Marion connected with<03e0>the Remnant, her soul traveled to<03e0>the Sacred Lands.<04e0>She still looks upon us from the heavens.<03e0>She prays for the souls of the dead to<03e0>safely reach the heavens to join her side.
When the dragon let out a fierce howl,<03e0>the lives of many were snatched away.<03e0>But we must not live in fear.<04e0>Lady Marion is always looking down upon us.<03e0>She wishes our souls to always be at peace.
This is the temple dedicated to Marion Marshall.<04e0>You saw the statue up front, didn't you? It's a statue<03e0>of Lady Marion. She has the most peaceful look on<03e0>her face, doesn't she?
More and more people have come to pray here since<03e0>the war was brought on by the Conqueror's army.<04e0>So many lives have been lost...<04e0>Everyone's worried about what's to come, but I have<03e0>hope that we'll be alright.<04e0>We have the Lady Marion with us.<03e0>She will bring us a bright future.<03e0>She must...
I'm just here visiting, but seems to me that this place<03e0>really has a distinct air to it<07f0>one not found anyplace<03e0>else.<04e0>The people who come here really seem to believe that<03e0>the legendary Marion Marshall truly existed.<04e0>She is a beauty, isn't she? Seeing this statue, I can see<03e0>why they want to believe she existed!
I think I've begun to understand why so many people<03e0>come to places like this.<04e0>The thought of some higher power like Marion Marshall<03e0>watching over us really gives a sense of relief and<03e0>security.
This is the resting place of souls.<03e0>No one may enter.
What? You wish to go through these doors?<04e0>The Marquis of Athlum...!<03e0>Well, I can hardly say no to your lordship.<03e0>I will unlock the doors at once.<04e0>But please refrain from telling anyone<03e0>about this, my lord.
The Catacombs are beyond this door.<03e0>Fierce creatures roam within.<03e0>Be safe!
The doors are shut tight.
