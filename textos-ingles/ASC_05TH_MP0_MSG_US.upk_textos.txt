Many young women have disappeared around the <1be0ffbe34ff>Gaslin<03e0>Caves<1ce0>. At the same time, a seedy group has been seen<03e0>around the <1be0ffbe34ff>Robelia Ruins<1ce0>.<04e0>Which will you investigate first?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The Gaslin Caves<09e008e0010000000000>The Robelia Ruins
The caves, then?<03e0>Go. Blocter will accompany you.
The ruins, then?<03e0>Go. Pagus will accompany you.
Then, you're decided?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah, let's check it out!<09e008e0010000000000>Mmm...maybe I'd better switch...
The <1be0ffbe34ff>Gaslin Caves<1ce0> and <1be0ffbe34ff>Robelia Ruins<1ce0>... Perhaps a clue<03e0>to finding Miss Irina can be found there.
I appreciate your assistance at the Gaslin Caves.<04e0>...I see, Miss Irina was not there.<04e0>Perhaps there is a clue to be found with the unsavory<03e0>types seen gathering at the <1be0ffbe34ff>Robelia Castle ruins<1ce0>.<04e0>Pagus, I leave the rest to you.

Many young women have been seen there<03e0>in the company of a certain group.<04e0>Blocter, try not to go too overboard.

Rush, I want you to go to <1be0ffbe34ff>Dillmoor<1ce0> along with my<03e0>Generals.<04e0>Be careful.
Ah, yes.<03e0>Rush, there was something I wanted to give you.<03e0>Emma, if you would?
The battles from now on will only become fiercer.<03e0>I hope that this jacket will make it a little easier<03e0>for you.
Thanks, Dave.
Celapaleis has sighted men matching the description<03e0>of the ones we encountered in Dillmoor. They request<03e0>we look into it at once.<04e0>Once you've completed your preparations, let us head<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Blackdale<1ce0>.
A girl matching Irina's description was seen in<03e0>the clutches of the flying Remnant.<04e0>So, this is the true face of the men slighting Athlum...<03e0>I will find them and make them regret this!
To reach the holy city of <1be0ffbe34ff>Elysion<1ce0>, we must cross the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Ivory Peaks<1ce0>, a mountain range to the southeast of here.<04e0>It won't be an easy journey, so make sure you're<03e0>ready, Rush.
Rush, if you're ever in need of more soldiers, speak<03e0>with the security guard in the <1be0ffbe34ff>Town Square<1ce007f0>he's an<03e01be0ffbe34ff>army recruitment officer<1ce0>.<04e0>I'll see to it that plenty of soldiers will be available to<03e0>you at any time. Some of them may be...strange, to say<03e0>the least, but they're all good men.
The Sykes have left the main campus of the Academy<03e0>and should be within the <1be0ffbe34ff>Temple of Elysion<1ce0>.<04e0>Let's head to the temple, Rush.
I suppose that even Emma has things she<03e0>cannot tell me about.<04e0>...Go on, Rush. I'll take care of your father.
The dragon castle of <1be0ffbe34ff>Nagapur<1ce0> is to the northeast<03e0>of Elysion, past the <1be0ffbe34ff>Heroic Ramparts<1ce0>.<04e0>Hurry and get ready. I'd like to head to Nagapur<03e0>as soon as possible.
The Conqueror's supremacy on the battlefield has been<03e0>more than proven. At this rate, it is only a matter of<03e0>time before Celapaleis falls.<04e0>We cannot allow that to happen! All forces<07f0>to the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Nest of Eagles<1ce0>!
Our true foe is the Duke of Nagapur<07f0>Wilfred<03e0>Hermeien. No more will we be puppets in his<03e0>petty farce.<04e0>To <1be0ffbe34ff>Nagapur<1ce0>...and to vengeance!
Hey, Rush. Before you leave town, make sure<03e0>your equipment is all set, alright?
Let's do it, Rush!
Rush! Those thugs've probably got a Remnant.<03e0>Don't think it's gonna be a cakewalk, alright?
Rush, if you've got some extra <1be0ffbe34ff>components<1ce0>, you<03e0>should take 'em down to the <1be0ffbe34ff>Customization Shop<1ce0>.<03e0>They can fix your equipment up good!
Ugh, I can't stand those jerks in Celapaleis. They're<03e0>always like "Athlum, do this! Athlum, do that!" It really<03e0>burns me up!<04e0>Like, this time. Sure, it's good to know bad stuff's going<03e0>on, but you don't gotta gloat when you tell it! Makes me<03e0>just wanna<07f0>argh!
Going to Elysion for the Congress, huh... I can't help<03e0>but feel nervous. You understand, I bet!<04e0>Not like either of us would be taking part, though!
My gramps used to tell me stories about the Temple<03e0>of Elysion... Like, how there was a place in there where<03e0>they used to put dead folks...<04e0>You...you don't think we'd have to go to that part, do<03e0>you? No way, right?
Oi, Rush. Don't slow Lady Emma down too much, got it?<03e0>If you make her angry, it won't be the monsters you'll<03e0>have to worry about! Gahahaha!<04e0>Don't worry about your pop, alright? I'll take good care<03e0>of him, no matter what!
If Athlum could get its independence, then...oh man.<03e0>It'd be like a dream or something... I sure hope these<03e0>talks with Duke Hermeien go well!
What kind of monsters are the Conqueror's army made<03e0>of!? Sneaking around behind our backs<07f0>what,<03e0>they've never heard of sportsmanship?<04e0>C'mon, Rush, we gotta hurry to the Nest of Eagles<03e0>and show those cowards what real men are made of!
When I first became one of the Four Generals,<03e0>Lady Emma would bust my hump every single<03e0>day.<04e0>It took me a while, but I realized that I really<03e0>appreciated those words...they're what made me<03e0>into the man I am today.<04e0>The Conqueror...that bastard Hermeien...<03e0>I'll never forgive them for what they did. Never!
The Gaslin Caves are a stretch of caverns<03e0>created by massive earthquakes long before<03e0>Athlum was founded.<04e0>Robelia Castle was built 300 years ago by Baron<03e0>Vonn d'Herouet, who, incidentally, was later<03e0>betrayed by one of his vassals and killed.<04e0>By now, both locations have come to be<03e0>inhabited by monsters and criminals...
I look forward to working with you, Rush.
Rush, we should not waste any time. Let us rescue<03e0>Miss Irina as soon as possible!
A mage wearing white and a flying Remnant have been<03e0>confirmed among the troops sighted invading Blackdale.<04e0>It's no question that they must be the same men we<03e0>encountered at Dillmoor...<04e0>We must be careful not to underestimate them. Keep<03e0>your head about you, Rush.
As I'm sure you already know, the Academy is a<03e0>worldwide organization which officially oversees all<03e0>Remnant-related research.<04e0>If that Wagram character truly is connected to the<03e0>Academy, he has very influential backing. It will be no<03e0>simple matter to go after him.
As you probably know, Elysion is a city at the center<03e0>of the continent.<04e0>Along the way, I'm sure we'll face unknown monsters<03e0>and new groups of bandits...<04e0>Well, we'll know once we see them!
Within the Temple of Elysion is a location known as<03e0>the Catacombs.<04e0>Once it was a burial place, but nowadays it is more<03e0>infamous as the birthplace of many<07f0>strange monsters.<04e0>Strange, as in...how can I put this... It's<07f0>difficult<03e0>to explain. Allow me to just say that I am not very<03e0>fond of the Catacombs.
Emma may be going with you, but you should still be<03e0>very careful. Danger lurks around every corner.
The Duke of Nagapur, Wilfred Hermeien, is a youthful<03e0>and extremely capable ruler. However, he is rumored to<03e0>be as cruel as he is clever...<04e0>If there is any hope for these negotiations to succeed,<03e0>we will have to be at least fractionally as shrewd as he is.
The Celapaleis forces are being heavily battered by the<03e0>Conqueror's army.<04e0>At this rate it's only a matter of time before they invade<03e0>the city. Rush, we must head to the Nest of Eagles<03e0>with all haste!
Miss Emmy is the spitting image of her mother when<03e0>she was young. It takes me back to when I first met<03e0>Lady Emma...<04e0>We will not allow her sacrifice to have been in vain!<04e0>Duke Hermeien's machinations stop here!
Remember, you're before Lord David now.<03e0>Watch your tongue.
Hmph, you're surprisingly competent.<04e0>Still, the next battle stands to be difficult.<03e0>Make certain you're amply prepared.
Going so far as to require Lord David to come along as<03e0>part of their "request"... Celapaleis really loves rubbing<03e0>our faces in it.<04e0>Still, this could be a good chance to learn what that<03e0>magus in white is all about. We won't be letting him off<03e0>easily this time.
Athlum is required to provide for Celapaleis's defense<03e0>at all times.<04e0>Their assumption that we'll always protect them is<03e0>something that is far from popular within Athlum.<03e0>Yet it is our duty as a territory.<04e0>I know it, and understand it, but I certainly don't like<03e0>it.
Elysion is considered the capital of the continent.<04e0>A mass of rock floats above the city, called the<03e0>Sacred Lands. It's quite an impressive sight.<04e0>Still, before all that, there's a long road ahead.<03e0>Don't slack on your preparations.
There are many temples in Elysion's Genaade<03e0>District. The Temple of Elysion in particular has<03e0>a long and venerable history.<04e0>Considering how secretive the group we're dealing<03e0>with is, I doubt it will be a simple thing for us to<03e0>enter the Temple...<04e0>Hmph, whatever. If our words aren't convincing<03e0>enough, then our blades will have to be.
I have an idea of where Marina might have run<03e0>to. We made each other a promise, once...<04e0>I'll be waiting in Elysion's Hendler section. Find<03e0>me there when you're ready.
Lord David seems to be getting stronger by the<03e0>day.<04e0>I had no idea he'd thought so deeply on<03e0>Athlum's independence.<04e0>He's come quite a long way from the little boy<03e0>who clung to my skirts after his mother passed.
Hmph. To be certain, at first I only thought you<03e0>a silly, sheltered hayseed, but you've really<03e0>grown a lot. I admit I'm a bit impressed.<04e0>That said, don't get too full of yourself, Rush.
So...<03e0>You are the son of the famed Doctors Sykes.<04e0>Lord David is completely committed to helping<03e0>you locate your sister Irina.
There is still much we do not know about Remnants.<03e0>The idea of one that can fly ought not be so shocking...
The men spotted in Dillmoor were accompanied<03e0>by an unidentified Remnant. Make haste in your<03e0>preparations so that we may set out.
While to the uninitiated it may appear as if we<03e0>were equals, in actuality Athlum is a territory<03e0>under Celapaleis's domain.<04e0>Still, to require Lord David to chase after a<03e0>simple group of unknowns is a situation I would<03e0>prefer be avoided in the future.
It is rumored that there are segments of the<03e0>Academy dedicated to more...illicit types of<03e0>Remnant testing.<04e0>Mayhap the mage in white is a part of that...<04e0>Still, we do not yet have the evidence to<03e0>confirm either way. We must learn more about<03e0>these men before anything else.
Many Lords will assemble for the Congress<03e0>session<07f0>all rulers of important and influential<03e0>countries. Please refrain from any rash actions.
As we have already been called out... Let's try<03e0>to avoid any actions that would further draw<03e0>Chairman Hermeien's attention, shall we?<04e0>Please try to exercise discretion in searching<03e0>the Temple.
Information she is unwilling to reveal to Lord<03e0>David? It isn't like Emma at all.<04e0>What could be so important to require only the<03e0>two of you to go<07f0>to an unknown location, at<03e0>that?<04e0>No doubt the battles you will face along the way<03e0>will be harsher than any you've encountered thus<03e0>far. Prepare yourself accordingly.
Any concession we attempt to get from Duke<03e0>Hermeien will likely be paid for by Athlum<03e0>being sent to fight the Conqueror.<04e0>I wish Lord David success in his negotiations,<03e0>yet...
While we were in Nagapur, the Conqueror's army<03e0>advanced all the way to Celapaleis...<03e0>Unbelievable.<04e0>To think, they dominated so easily... The<03e0>Conqueror seems rightly named.<04e0>If we take this lightly, we'll be destroyed along<03e0>with Celapaleis.<04e0>We'll need to keep our wits about us.
Emma traded her life to protect this country.<03e0>Now, we who are left must do all we can to<03e0>honor that.<04e0>Wilfred Hermeien is the one behind all this. We<03e0>will find him and we will destroy him. Emma's<03e0>sacrifice will not have been in vain.
Hermeien used the Conqueror's army to throw the whole<03e0>world into confusion...that's unforgivable.<04e0>I'll avenge my mother with these hands, I swear it!<03e0>Rush, let's get to Nagapur as soon as possible!
Fornstrand...?<03e0>There's supposed to be a Remnant there?
A report from the new chairman...Duke Ghor.<04e0>He's learnt there is a major Remnant located at<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Fornstrand<1ce0>, on the dark sea to the north of the<03e0>continent.<04e0>Let's not waste any time, Rush.
Let's hurry to <1be0ffbe34ff>Fornstrand<1ce0>, Rush.
Rush, there's been another urgent summons from<03e0>the Congress. We must head to <1be0ffbe34ff>Elysion<1ce0> at once.<04e0>...Please, don't worry about Irina.<04e0>She just wants to be by your side...even if that<03e0>journey takes her to the battlefield. She cares for<03e0>you, Rush.
It will take some time for Dr. Sykes to finish his<03e0>adjustments, so you're free to do what you like until<03e0>then. I'll send for you when there's any news.
Chairman Ghor has asked us all back to <1be0ffbe34ff>Elysion<1ce0> for<03e0>an emergency meeting of the Congress.<04e0>If Miss Irina wishes to come along as well, I have no<03e0>complaints. She's proven herself to be a skilled<03e0>researcher...much like her parents.
It seems that most of the Lords have been struck by<03e0>sudden and fierce illnesses.<04e0>I cannot believe this is just coincidence. We must look<03e0>into this further.
There is something terribly wrong with Duke Qubine.<04e0>Rush, let's head to <1be0ffbe34ff>Ghor<1ce0>. The chairman should be<03e0>informed of this as soon as possible.<04e0>The warrior town of Ghor is just west of the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Heroic Ramparts<1ce0>.
It seems we will have to do something about the<03e0>black lights around <1be0ffbe34ff>Koenigsdorf<1ce0> if we wish to enter.<04e0>Take care in your preparations, Rush. I've a feeling<03e0>these battles will be fiercer than we can even expect.
Irina seemed troubled by her powers, but I had no idea<03e0>it would come to this...<04e0>No, there's no time for that. Let's hurry to <1be0ffbe34ff>Darken<03e0>Forest<1ce0>. I made a promise...I cannot allow Irina to be<03e0>embroiled in our war any more than I already have.
The road to the imperial city is long and harsh.<04e0>Past the highlands stretching east of Elysion,<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Berechevaltelle<1ce0>, and then over <1be0ffbe34ff>Mt. Vackel<1ce0>...<03e0>There lies <1be0ffbe34ff>Undelwalt<1ce0>.<04e0>However, this is my first duty as representative<03e0>of the Congress Chairman, and I intend to do it<03e0>properly.<04e0>Rush, once you've finished your preparations<03e0>we will set out.
To reach <1be0ffbe34ff>Undelwalt<1ce0>, we must travel east<03e0>of Elysion to the great plains, <1be0ffbe34ff>Berechevaltelle<1ce0>;<03e0>and through there, climb <1be0ffbe34ff>Mt. Vackel<1ce0>.<04e0>Let me know when you're ready, Rush; we'll<03e0>leave once your preparations are complete.
...You know, the first time I laid eyes on you, I<03e0>was struck by how simple-minded and naïve<03e0>you seemed.<04e0>I knew you bore some special power. I thought<03e0>that if I kept you close, I could control you, and<03e0>have you use that power to Athlum's advantage.<04e0>But hearing your words, I realized I've been<03e0>blind. You've been the one in control all along<07f003e0>showing me the way.<04e0>In the end, it's I who's truly been simple-minded.<03e0>Thank you, Rush.<04e0>...Well. I suppose this really isn't the time for<03e0>such sentimental drivel.<04e0>All of Athlum's forces are to take up arms and<03e0>strike down the Conqueror! To the <1be0ffbe34ff>Holy Plain<1ce0>!
The Conqueror is in the <1be0ffbe34ff>Sacred Lands<1ce0>.<03e0>He cannot be allowed to roam free any longer.<03e0>He must be stopped!
Rush, what is it?<04e0>A sovani? Ah, Leucetius...<03e0>Now that I think of it, he did seem to have had<03e0>some urgent complaint he wanted to voice...<04e0>Either way, we just had a brief chat, then he left.<03e0>It's nothing you need to worry about.
Fornstrand, huh?<03e0>I don't really like that place...<04e0>The sky's always covered with dark clouds...<03e0>It kinda gives me the willies.
Heya, Rush! Good news about your pop, huh. He was<03e0>out of it for so long, I figured he was never gonna get<03e0>better...<04e0>Weeell, it all worked out, right? Sometimes it's good<03e0>when I'm wrong!
Geez Louise, that Duke Ghor is a friggin' slave driver!<03e0>Doesn't he ever remember that Athlum is far from just<03e0>about everywhere?<04e0>Still, this time, the little missy's coming along, huh.<03e0>Should be fun!
Geez-oh-Pete... Sure, the Lords are important and all,<03e0>but how come we've gotta find out what's wrong with<03e0>'em? I thought that's what doctors were for...
I never seen Duke Qubine lookin' like that before...<03e0>Usually he's kinda mouthy and annoying, but now<03e0>I'm a little worried about him...
Those black lights, huh... Wonder what we're gonna find?<04e0>Ehh, doesn't matter<07f0>whatever it is, I'm gonna knock it<03e0>into next week! Aw geez! I'm shaking...with excitement!
What...what!? Going all alone to that creepy forest,<03e0>what was that girl thinking!?<04e0>C'mon, Rush, what're you standing around here for?<03e0>We gotta go find Irina and bring her back!
Rush, didja hear!? We just got independence from<03e0>Celapaleis! Incredible, ain't it? I'm so psyched up,<03e0>I can't sit still!<04e0>Guess even that Qubine kid can be a nice guy<03e0>sometimes!
This might sound kinda sappy, but I'm real glad I've had<03e0>the chance to fight alongside you and the young master.<04e0>But seriously, Rush, if you think we're gonna let you<03e0>face the Conqueror all alone, you're dead wrong.<04e0>Whether you're marching to the Sacred Lands or to the<03e0>gates of the underworld itself, it doesn't matter. We're<03e0>brothers now<07f0>together 'til the end!<04e0>Awright! Time to take a deep breath and knock that<03e0>Conqueror from here to next Tuesday!
Heya, Rush.<04e0>What's the deal with that sovani, Leucetius?<04e0>He busted in here all, "If you won't make me leader,<03e0>I'll take the position myself!"<04e0>It wasn't much trouble to chase him off, though.
It's been some time since the Congress elected the<03e0>Duke of Ghor as the new chairman, but still...<04e0>I'm continually astonished at how he can work people<03e0>so hard.
Hrm, the Conqueror still lives...<04e0>Well, getting worked up won't help anyone think of a<03e0>good way to solve this problem.<04e0>For now, let's take it day by day... Do what we can<03e0>and don't worry about the rest just yet, Rush.
Ever since her father recovered, Miss Irina has been<03e0>quite engrossed in Remnant research. It seems the skill<03e0>runs in the family.<04e0>You and Miss Irina have grown so quickly!<03e0>Ahh, to be young again...
If this trend of illnesses continues,<03e0>I worry for Lord David's health...
As if the Conqueror wasn't enough of a headache, now<03e0>there's even more to deal with... For now, we should<03e0>report to Chairman Ghor and let him deal with this.
Those dark lights surrounding Koenigsdorf...<04e0>Whatever is at each of those locations will do its worst<03e0>to prevent us from getting to the Conqueror.<04e0>From now on, our battles will be fierce. Let's make<03e0>certain we are amply prepared before we proceed.
It's said the mysterious Darken Forest has two very<03e0>different faces.<04e0>One a beautiful, sun-dappled grove, the other a dank,<03e0>smothering wildwood out of a nightmare...<04e0>It's rumored that within the forest is an unbound<03e0>Remnant, spawning many monsters. We should go<03e0>after Miss Irina right away!
The imperial city of Undelwalt is an ancient and storied<03e0>city.<04e0>Once it was a bustling metropolis like Elysion, but ever<03e0>since the Congress was formed, the God Emperor's<03e0>influence has waned, and with it, the might of the city.<04e0>To be honest, Undelwalt feels a bit run-down.
Rush... Since meeting you, we and Lord David have all<03e0>changed a great deal.<04e0>From being preoccupied with the affairs of a single small<03e0>city, we've somehow come to be at the forefront of a<03e0>battle that affects the future of the entire world.<04e0>It's a bit of a change in scale, to say the least.<03e0>It's thanks to you that our horizons have been broadened<03e0>so, and for that you have my deepest appreciation.<04e0>...Anyhow! It's well past time for the final showdown,<03e0>isn't it? Let's finish off the Conqueror, once and for all!
It's imperative that we find a new Remnant to<03e0>restore the faith of the Athlum people as soon<03e0>as possible.<04e0>Without the Valeria Heart, the unease of the<03e0>people is palpable.
To think, the Conqueror's lackeys survived...<04e0>I'm certain the Congress will move to take<03e0>action, but we must stay on our guard.
While Chairman Ghor does tend to act as soon<03e0>as the idea hits, this sudden Congress session<03e0>seems based on an actual emergency.<04e0>Granted, this is all supposition based on what<03e0>little can be gleaned from a visistone<03e0>recording...
It is unheard of for the Lords to be absent at a session<03e0>of the Congress. I cannot help but have a bad feeling<03e0>about this...
That uneasy feeling only increases, day by day... I can<03e0>only hope that I am overestimating the gravity of this<03e0>situation.
Extrapolating from Miss Irina's words, the<03e0>locations signified by those black points are, like<03e0>Hermeien, imbued with the power of a Remnant.<04e0>The thought that there are multiple bearers of<03e0>such strength is distressing at best. For now,<03e0>we must extinguish the threats one by one.
Darken Forest is a wood that corresponds to<03e0>reality. It can change its very form in response<03e0>to the man brave<07f0>or foolish<07f0>enough to enter it.<04e0>That is an ancient sovani saying.<04e0>Upon entering the forest, you will be able to<03e0>feel the movement of the trees. Surely we will<03e0>be able to feel Miss Irina's strong will as well.
Independence for Athlum was the deepest wish<03e0>of the former Marquis.<04e0>For it to have come to pass in this way, while<03e0>muchly due to David's efforts, is also due to<03e0>your help.
Of late I have been surprised to see the rate of Lord<03e0>David's development.<04e0>At first I thought he'd finally gained the former Marquis's<03e0>spirit...but no. He's learnt more than that through these<03e0>harrowing battles.<04e0>I do not know exactly how, but it's due to you, Rush.<03e0>Walking this path with you has allowed him to grow in<03e0>ways we could not teach him.<04e0>Together, let us face the Conqueror, and defeat him.<03e0>And afterwards...please, continue to be at David's side.
An unknown Remnant at Fornstrand...<04e0>Well, it's known of now... No doubt some shady types<03e0>are going to go after it. Don't let down your guard, Rush.
Rush! Good to hear about your dad.<04e0>But...seems no good news comes without bad news<03e0>coming on its heels...<04e0>I didn't even imagine the Conqueror was still alive...<03e0>I will get revenge for Mother, I swear it!
Did you see your sister's expression when you suggested<03e0>she come along?<04e0>I'd never seen her that happy. Seems she's wanted to be<03e0>with you<07f0>or be accepted by you<07f0>for a while.<04e0>Don't worry, we Generals aren't going to let anything<03e0>happen to her!
It's awfully strange for all the Lords to get sick at the<03e0>same time. I have a bad feeling about this.
Duke Qubine was talking about feeling someone else's<03e0>thoughts...what was that all about?<04e0>We'd better keep our wits about us, alright, Rush?<03e0>Don't get careless!
I can't believe Hermeien appeared in Ghor... And Irina<03e0>said he had the same strange aura as those black<03e0>points on the Remnant locator.<04e0>No doubt he's completely bonkers...and all the more<03e0>dangerous because of it.<04e0>Rush, don't underestimate him.
Irina's always been so responsible... There's got to be<03e0>a good reason for her to have gone someplace like<03e0>Darken Forest all by herself.<04e0>That said, it's not like she had to go alone. No matter<03e0>what the reason was, all of us would've been willing<03e0>to help.<04e0>No use saying this to you, hmm? Instead, let's hurry<03e0>and get Irina back.
Rush! It seems Athlum's already taken its first step<03e0>towards independence.<04e0>I think...even Mother can hear everyone's happy cries.<03e0>If I listen closely, I think I can hear hers.
Ever since Mother died, and I became one of the<03e0>Generals of Athlum, I've dreamt of getting revenge<03e0>on the Conqueror.<04e0>I thought that killing him would avenge her, and that<03e0>was enough for me.<04e0>But, after spending all this time with you, I can't help<03e0>but think that thought was awfully small-minded.<04e0>Solely thinking of revenge probably isn't going to<03e0>change the world<07f0>not for the better, at least. It<03e0>probably will only spawn some other act of violence.<04e0>And I'm tired of this endless fighting. This cycle needs<03e0>to end. So, more than revenge, that's why I want to<03e0>stop the Conqueror.<04e0>You've helped me open my eyes to the bigger picture,<03e0>Rush. I appreciate it.
Hello there, Rush.<04e0>Oh yes, some incredibly rude sovani came through here<03e0>not too long ago; wanted to be made leader of our party<03e0>or some such nonsense.<04e0>I tried to tell him that there was nothing I could do about<03e0>it, but he just wouldn't listen. In the end, I had to beat<03e0>some sense into him.
Hey, you two, if things get hairy, just run away, got it?
Alternate routes to the Sacred Lands...<03e0>Well, that place is so linked to Remnants, stands to<03e0>reason there's at least one other way to get up there...
Once all this is over with, how about we all return to<03e0>Eulam, huh? Buck up, kiddo, we're on the home stretch.
Rush, Irina...<03e0>Please take care of yourselves.
A Remnant to travel to the Sacred Lands...<04e0>Fath<07f0>er, I mean, Oswald might know something.
Rush...Irina...<03e0>No matter what happens, we'll always be a family.<03e0>Never forget that.
Rush, I'll do what I can!<04e0>But don't worry<07f0>I'll run if things get<03e0>too dangerous.
A Remnant to go to the Sacred Lands?<04e0>The people of the Academy may know something.
Rush...<04e0>When this is all over, we're all going home<03e0>safe and sound, right?<03e0>Promise?
