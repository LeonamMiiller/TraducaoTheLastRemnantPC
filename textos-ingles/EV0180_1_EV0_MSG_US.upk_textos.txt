I don't know how to thank you and your master,<03e0>Lord Blocter, enough!
Thank you! Finally, we can go back home...<03e0>Hm? No, I haven't seen any other girls but us.<03e0>I don't think those hoodlums got anyone else...
Thank you so much! I'll never forget this!
So, from the look on yer face, I can tell you didn't<03e0>find your sis. Thinking about where we are an' why,<03e0>I dunno if that's a good or a bad thing...<04e0>Anyway, there's no point in getting all down about it,<03e0>right? C'mon, let's head back to Athlum.
