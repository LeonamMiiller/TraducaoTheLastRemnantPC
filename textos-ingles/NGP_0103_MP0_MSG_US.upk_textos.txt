This is the biggest shopping district in Nagapur<07f003e01be0ffbe34ff>Nordenalm<1ce0>.<04e0>Weapons and accessories, components and items...<03e0>Products from around the world are sailed here through<03e0>the canals!<04e0>There is a pub and guild here as well, if that suits your<03e0>fancy.
I hear whispers of an upcoming war.<03e0>Make sure you pop into the shops around<03e0>here and buy what you need to ready yourself.

After the Gwayn turned the town into a fiery mess, the<03e0>survivors all fled to Nordenalm, since most of it was left<03e0>intact.<04e0>All we could do was stand and watch while our town<03e0>went up in flames...
Look at how gallant the Gwayn stands.<04e0>With that guarding our town, only a fool would think<03e0>of invading us.<04e0>...Though, my kid tends to burst into tears when he<03e0>sees it. I have to admit, it can be slightly intimidating.<04e0>That's when I tell him that our town stays safe<03e0>because of that Remnant. The Gwayn protects us<03e0>from the evil out there!
My kid asked me if there was going to be a war. He must<03e0>have heard about the Conqueror and his army.<04e0>I told him that the Gwayn will protect us, so there's<03e0>nothing to worry about. I've never seen a bigger smile<03e0>on his face.

Everyone's saying that the Gwayn went on a mindless<03e0>rampage, but I disagree.<04e0>The town would have been destroyed by the Conqueror<03e0>if the Gwayn hadn't done what it did.<04e0>I want to believe... No, I do believe that the Gwayn was<03e0>trying to protect us from them.
There's quite a large sewer beneath the town. It<03e0>connects the canals.<04e0>There have been monster sightings there of late, so<03e0>no civilians are allowed to enter that area.
The entrance to the Aqueducts?<03e0>...Oh, you mean the sewer.<03e0>It's in Sudenalm.<04e0>You're not thinking of going there, are you?<04e0>It's dark, damp, and worst of all, the smell is<03e0>horrendous! Not to mention that it's filled with<03e0>monsters!<04e0>Nothing is worth going down there.

As long as I live in this town, I'll never be able to forget<03e0>what happened.<04e0>This town is absolutely desolate now. So many people<03e0>have left in fear of the same thing happening again.<04e0>I'm not one of them, though. I was born here. This is<03e0>my home. No one could ever get me to leave, no<03e0>matter what happens.
Never would I have dreamt that Nagapur<03e0>would end up in such a state.<04e0>If only there was something I could do<03e0>to help this town and its people.
Well? Are you finished?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure am!<09e008e0010000000300>No, not just yet.
Alright, meet me in Flussbahn.
I said to come to me when you've finished.<03e0>Not a moment sooner.
Hello, Rush.<04e0>I can't thank you enough for allowing me to join you.
I've traveled far and wide, searching<03e0>for something powerful. On my journey,<03e0>I caught word of an old legend.<04e0>Somewhere in the world exists a weapon<03e0>of extraordinary power.<04e0>With it, one can defeat even the strongest<03e0>of foes.
It is said that somewhere in the world<03e0>exists a weapon of extraordinary power.<03e0>I wonder if this is true.
Standing here, watching passers-by,<03e0>reminds me of my hometown.<04e0>The same sun shines through the blue<03e0>skies, causing shadows behind the buildings.<04e0>My town was not rich, but there was<03e0>an abundance of happiness and joy.<04e0>I wish I could go see it with my own<03e0>eyes once more...
I wish I could see it with my own<03e0>eyes once more...
When my town burned to the ground,<03e0>all I could do was stand there and<03e0>stare at what had become of it.<04e0>That image... It is not something I<03e0>will ever forget as long as I live and breathe.<04e0>I've traveled across many lands in search<03e0>of the man who caused such devastation.<04e0>He will continue to roam the world<03e0>until I get my revenge. That is when<03e0>my journey will end.
My journey will end when I get revenge<03e0>on the one responsible for causing<03e0>such devastation to my town.
Greetings.<04e0>I have been yearning for revenge,<03e0>but no more.<04e0>My memories with him, my desert<03e0>town that no longer exists<07f0>both<03e0>have become a special part of me.<04e0>Whatever happens, I will always have<03e0>them to keep me strong.<04e0>If it's no burden, I would like to<03e0>join you on your journey.<04e0>Perhaps it will allow me to find<03e0>a new goal in life.
Hello, Rush.<04e0>Everyone is kind and generous.<03e0>I am enjoying myself, something I<03e0>was not able to do for a long time.
Good morning!<04e0>Is everything alright?
I need to rest. I feel a bit dizzy...<04e0>What? Me? Lost? Of course not!<03e0>Don't be silly!
I need to rest. I feel a bit dizzy...
Maybe I worked myself too hard at Kosmosfest...<04e0>O-oh! H-hi, Rush! You don't need to worry about me.<03e0>I'll be better in no time!
Maybe I worked myself too hard at the festival...
Lately, it seems like my powers aren't as strong as<03e0>they used to be. This has never happened to me before...<03e0>I really don't get it.<04e0>During Kosmosfest, I felt my powers heighten like<03e0>never before. I could sense so many Remnants...<04e0>But once the festival ended, that super power went<03e0>with it. Maybe...maybe I used too much, so my body<03e0>needs time to recharge?<04e0>I'm really getting worried. What if this isn't temporary?<03e0>What should I do? A Cosmos Maiden needs her<03e0>powers, you know?<04e0>Maybe I should go talk to Mistress Marsha... She might<03e0>know what to do.
Lately, my powers have gotten really weak...<03e0>I don't know what to do!<03e0>Maybe I should go talk to Mistress Marsha.
Oh... This is a parfumlily, right?<03e0>It's beautiful. That's so sweet of you...<04e0>Hm? That's funny...<03e0>I feel...stronger, somehow.<03e0>Like my powers have come back...<04e0>Now that I think of it, my mother always told me<03e0>that a Maiden's powers were like waves...<04e0>Endlessly flowing from the sea to the land, and<03e0>back out to sea, the power becomes one with<03e0>the earth...<04e0>Ahh...I think I finally get it!<04e0>My power<07f0>my hopes and dreams become strength<03e0>for others... But their supportive thoughts return and<03e0>replenish my power.<04e0>Thank you so much, Rush! I feel so much better<03e0>now, and it's all due to you.
I'm all better now!<03e0>I want to keep traveling the world.<03e0>Just come looking for me if I get lost, okay?
There've been a lot of cases of kids going missing<03e0>from town lately. My niece being one of them...<04e0>I've been doing some searching of my own, but no luck.<03e0>Dammit!<04e0>I can't open up shop with this hanging over my head.
Hey, I heard you solved the kidnapping cases in town.<04e0>When my niece came back home, I hugged her so tight.<03e0>I never wanted to let her go.<04e0>With that debacle over with, I was able to open shop<03e0>again. Take a look around!
