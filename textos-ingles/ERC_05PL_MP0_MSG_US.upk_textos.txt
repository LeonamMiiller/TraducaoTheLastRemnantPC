Welcome to the Heavenly Terrace.<03e0>What would you like to know about?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The neighboring cities<09e008e0010000000000>The Academy<09e008e0020000000000>You
Elysion's central location makes it simple to travel to<03e0>many places from here. As for places worth visiting...<03e0>Hmm, let's see.<04e0>Balterossa, a large trade city to the southwest, has<03e0>a huge population and a great selection of goods.<04e0>Ooh, and there's Royotia, a mining town south past the<03e0>desert. The area is famous for quality ore.<04e0>Let's see... What other places are out there?<03e0>You should go see for yourself!
The Academy is a Remnant research facility found near<03e0>the assembly hall.<04e0>The Academy is heavily backed by the Congress.<03e0>Chairman Hermeien's obsession with Remnants borders<03e0>on unnatural.<04e0>He invests a lot of money to keep the Academy afloat.
Come back in ten years, cutie, when you've grown into<03e0>a real man<07f0>and I'll tell you anything you want to<03e0>know then. Anything. *wink*
Now that you've heard all about the other towns, it might<03e0>be a good time to go and see them with your own eyes.
Oh, I almost forgot!<04e0>Far to the southeast of Elysion is Melphina,<03e0>the town of scholars. I hear it's a beautiful<03e0>town surrounded by nature.<04e0>If only I could get a day off. I'd love to go<03e0>to Melphina and see for myself.
The Academy is the building across from the assembly<03e0>hall. With support from the Congress, they research<03e0>Remnants.<04e0>Under Duke Hermeien, there was some illegal<03e0>experimentation going on there, but all that's stopped<03e0>since the Duke of Ghor became Congress chairman.<04e0>It's become a decent organization again.
You want directions to other towns?<03e0>Listen carefully, sonny.<04e0>The <1be0ffbe34ff>Southwestern Road<1ce0> to the desert is used as a trade<03e0>route, but any merchant traveling that road takes plenty<03e0>of protection<07f0>and with good reason.<04e0>That place is crawling with monsters!<04e0>If you value your life, you won't take that road. Capice?
The army that was making a scene<03e0>on Tula Street... What was their business?<03e0>That lady was a looker, though, huh?<04e0>But where in the world is Veyriel?<03e0>I know my geography and I've never heard<03e0>of the town!
There are strongholds around Elysion that were built to<03e0>protect this city from invaders. Of course, they haven't<03e0>been used for hundreds of years.<04e0>But lately...there have been rumors of suspicious folks<03e0>hanging around them.<04e0>I don't know who's up to what, but it can't be good!
There are plenty of goodies to buy in Elysion, but I really<03e0>recommend the Blessed Buns.<04e0>They're soft and feathery on the outside, like clouds,<03e0>with a creamy filling, like the Remnant Elysion floating<03e0>within them.<04e0>One bite will take you to heaven<07f0>or the Sacred Lands.<04e0>Getting hungry?<03e0>They're sold in Hendler if you want to go home with<03e0>a pack or ten!
Hey, listen up.<04e0>I heard rumors of people hanging around the strongholds<03e0>at night and I decided to check it out for myself.<04e0>That's when I saw Lord Hermeien, who supposedly died<03e0>in the war!<04e0>I've told a few people but no one believes me.<03e0>But I know what I saw!
You've been thinking about that too, eh?<03e0>...Don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking<03e0>about! The barkeep!<04e0>The white lab coat she used to wear...<03e0>The blond hair that shines like the sun...<03e0>Fiery almond-shaped eyes full of life...<04e0>You're thinking of going after her, aren't you!? Well,<03e0>you should give up now. You know why?<04e0>If the research that my brother's doing in Melphina is<03e0>successful, she'll fall head over heels in love with me!<03e0>Hahaha!
You thought so, too, did you?<04e0>That army that came around talking about<03e0>dreams and such... It all has to be a ruse by<03e0>some lowly lord to get invited to the Congress.<04e0>That big guy in the armor must have been<03e0>the Conqueror, but he didn't emanate<03e0>a single ounce of intelligence or leadership!<04e0>This all has to be one big joke...
You've been thinking about that too, eh?<03e0>...Don't look at me like you don't know<03e0>what I'm talking about! The strongholds!<04e0>Rumor has it that shady-types have been seen using<03e0>them lately. Me, I think it's a bunch of ex-Academy<03e0>members doing some sort of "private" research.<04e0>Me and my brother used to do all kinds of experiments<03e0>when we were young... Hahaha!
The new Academy director, Ms. Haruko, is very skilled as<03e0>a scientist, but I'm not sure she has the management<03e0>skills to run the whole Academy.<04e0>She was probably put in that position temporarily, and<03e0>will soon be replaced by someone else<07f0>perhaps<03e0>John Sykes.
Ahh, the Academy's done for.<04e0>Once the Congress found out Hermeien had a group<03e0>doing underground Remnant research, not only did they<03e0>disband it, but they cut funds for the rest of us as well.<04e0>You can guess how well that went over... The only<03e0>scientists left are the ones who are really passionate<03e0>about what they do.<04e0>I think I'm on my way out, too. I guess I'll go back home<03e0>and marry the man my parents picked out after all.
I hear there's some unknown army making use of the<03e0>abandoned strongholds near Elysion.<04e0>They're not using just one, but several of them.<04e0>It...couldn't be the Conqueror's army, could it?<03e0>I was so certain they'd all perished in Nagapur...<04e0>Oh, I don't even want to entertain the thought!
Hehe, my days are so lax.
Then you're fired.
Hehe, my days are so busy.
You know Baron Nielsen of Celapaleis? Seems his<03e0>wife's disappeared. ...'Course, those two are famous<03e0>for not getting along, so it's nothing new.
Interesting, huh?
Why does he put up with that?<03e0>That is NOT acceptable behavior.
I heard someone's plotting to assassinate<03e0>Duke Qubine... Rumor has it a suspicious-<03e0>looking woman was spotted lurking about.
Interesting, huh?
And the idiots didn't bring her in for questioning?
So, apparently the desert princess has been<03e0>sneaking out of the castle pretty regularly to<03e0>meet some guy she's been mooning over.
Interesting, huh?
Children need to get into trouble and<03e0>receive punishment. Brats need a taste of<03e0>the real world!
...Speaking from experience, are you?
I heard the desert princess eloped with<03e0>her new man.
Interesting, huh?
Only fools elope! Stupid kids.<03e0>...<03e0>Why can't I find love...?
Hehe!
The conflict between Balterossa and<03e0>Royotia is getting worse by the day.<03e0>Everyone thinks there's a war coming.
Interesting, huh?
If people know it's coming, why don't<03e0>they do something to try to stop it<03e0>from happening? Lazy bastards...
...Easier said than done.
Rumor has it that in a certain moor,<03e0>the Imperator used his powers to<03e0>seal the entranceway to another realm.
Interesting, huh?
What a useless bastard. Why didn't<03e0>he just destroy it to save us grief?
...I think he would have, if that had<03e0>been an option.
If a Forest Maiden vows eternity with<03e0>a Melphinian knight, she gains the power to<03e0>see and hear whatever her partner does.
Interesting, huh?
That has got to be annoying!<03e0>Everyone needs their alone time.<03e0>Ugh, I could never do that.
...Don't worry<07f0>no one will ever ask you to.
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina<03e0>are getting ready for something big. I think something's<03e0>happened to the Last Leaf in Crookfen.
Interesting, huh?
See? I was right! The Imperator IS<03e0>a useless bastard! This wouldn't have<03e0>happened if he had destroyed the damn thing!
...Why don't you go back in time<03e0>a thousand years and tell him?
It's almost time for Kosmosfest, huh? But apparently<03e0>the Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to Nagapur yet.<03e0>Maybe she got mixed up in something.
Interesting, huh?
She's probably just taking her sweet<03e0>time getting ready.<03e0>Women are so vain!
...You're not?
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started<03e0>the festival alright. Usually it's a pretty quiet event<03e0>until the monsters show up.
Interesting, huh?
It's a festival! Lighten up!<03e0>Monsters? The more the merrier!
...You're happy as long as they buy<03e0>their refreshments here, right?
Some old-fashioned-looking woman is looking to<03e0>hire bodyguards, I hear. She's supposed to be<03e0>hanging out at a pub near the canal.
Interesting, huh?
Only weaklings need bodyguards.
...Not everyone is as strong as you.
Apparently, a lot of the treasures of the Old Kingdoms<03e0>are turning up on the black market.
Interesting, huh?
Out with the old, in with the new.
...I don't think that applies here.
Some guy is looking for these three stones that<03e0>play an important part in the desert's history.
Interesting, huh?
Someone's looking for stones?<03e0>There's a bunch in the back,<03e0>if anyone needs any.
Some guy researching the history of ancient magick<03e0>is looking for a little help. Maybe he can uncover<03e0>the secrets we've always wanted to know...
Interesting, huh?
Ooh! Maybe he can make me a love potion!
Apparently, some monster sealed by the Imperator<03e0>has appeared. It's really got people spooked, saying<03e0>it's the end of the world!
Interesting, huh?
Are we all going to die?<03e0>If that's the case, I'm going to withdraw my<03e0>life savings and go on a shopping spree!
...What are you going to do if<03e0>nothing happens and we're fine?
Some amnesiac is wandering around the cities<03e0>in the desert, looking for anything to help<03e0>regain his memory.
Interesting, huh?
Sometimes I wish I had amnesia.<03e0>There's a lot I'd like to forget about.
Don't worry. At your age, you'll be losing your memory<03e0>soon enough.
A notorious bandit is lurking around Athlum.<03e0>It seems he's waiting for someone but no one's<03e0>brave enough to ask.
Interesting, huh?
What if he tries to attack poor little me?<03e0>All bandits should be locked up!
There's a goddess statue in the Robelia Ruins<03e0>that's supposed to let you meet up with anyone<03e0>far away. A kid looking for his sister is asking about it.
Interesting, huh?
...<03e0>I...I have something in my eye...
...Are you crying!?
There's a murderer on the loose in the big city!
Interesting, huh?
What!?<03e0>Here!?
There's some massive yama looking for stuff.<03e0>He's acting kinda weird, though. People say<03e0>he's crazy.
Interesting, huh?
He's a yama, of course he's large.<03e0>...Anyway, I hope he comes here!
...Looking to make a profit, are you?
Some white qsiti's been looking for a mystical book.<03e0>People seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's<03e0>been able to place him.
Interesting, huh?
I've never liked the bookworm type.<03e0>He should go out and get some sun.
There's this set of twins that've turned up as<03e0>mercenaries lately...good ones, too. They're slightly<03e0>cold in attitude, but everyone wants to meet them!
Interesting, huh?
Men... *sigh*
Some fellow is hosting a game in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea. I wonder how<03e0>many people are gonna join in the fun.
Interesting, huh?
He has the right idea!<03e0>Life is all about fun.
...Strange, coming from a seedy barkeep<03e0>like yourself.
Some old warrior's crossed the Great Sand Sea,<03e0>looking for a special sword.
Interesting, huh?
Men love these kind of adventures.<03e0>I don't care if my man goes away<03e0>on a trip, as long as he keeps sending money!
...You are every man's nightmare.
A bunch of guards somewhere have sworn to<03e0>follow their ruler for as long as they live.
Interesting, huh?
If I were lord, I would work them<03e0>like my slaves.
There's not a family in the world as dedicated as<03e0>the Honeywells. If they've got your back,<03e0>you can relax.
Interesting, huh?
I wonder if they've got my back.
I heard in Royotia that apparently<03e0>Torgal of the Athlum generals is real<03e0>touchy about his past.
Interesting, huh?
Everyone has a touchy part of their<03e0>past. Some things I'll take with me<03e0>to the grave.
..Don't worry. No one's interested in<03e0>your past, anyway.
The competition to determine the Hero Exemplar<03e0>is about to start. I wonder how many are gonna<03e0>be up for the challenge.
Interesting, huh?
Yeah, good luck. Not interested.
I hear Mystic Arts Academy is a renowned school<03e0>and its graduates go on to do great things.
Interesting, huh?
With that kind of education, I bet<03e0>the graduates rake in the big bucks.
Athlum's had its share of hardships, and with<03e0>the new Honeywell girl being so young...<03e0>Well, people are worried.
Interesting, huh?
She'll do fine.<03e0>I have faith.
...Was that a compliment? From you?<03e0>What's wrong with you today?
A lot of the ladies are wondering why the Marquis<03e0>of Athlum has no lady in his life.<03e0>I can't see why<07f0>he's a good-looking fella.
Interesting, huh?
Who's to say he doesn't?<03e0>Ooh! I wish I could find out.
The ex-director of the Academy has been<03e0>spotted at pubs in various cities.
Interesting, huh?
She should come here!<03e0>I've always liked her!
...You just like her money.
It seems Dr. Sykes has been seen making frequent<03e0>trips to Athlum Castle lately.
Interesting, huh?
Dr. Sykes?<03e0>I used to work under her.
...You worked for the Academy?
A monster was spotted flying around Wyrmskeep.<03e0>It's got the town spooked!
Interesting, huh?
I wish a lot of things would go away,<03e0>but there are just some things you<03e0>have to live with.
Some bloodthirsty female warrior is trying to hunt down<03e0>the goons responsible for the incident at the moor,<03e0>against her boss's wishes.
Interesting, huh?
I wish some hottie would hunt ME down.
...Keep on dreaming.
A mob of ferocious monsters were spotted<03e0>in the Great Sand Sea. They're apparently so<03e0>powerful that Balterossa doesn't know what to do.
Interesting, huh?
Drama!<03e0>I should go have a looksie.
...You're a loon.
According to archaeologists, there's something<03e0>dangerous enough to destroy entire cities<03e0>hidden in the depths of a volcano.
Interesting, huh?
How scary!<03e0>But how much can you really trust<03e0>a weatherman's prediction?
...They're archaeologists, not meteorologists.
No one knows what's going on inside the volcano.<03e0>But lords have their ways of finding things out<07f003e0>no matter how impossible.
Interesting, huh?
How would a lord know something<03e0>a scientist doesn't even know?
...They have their ways.
A certain town just lost their lord, and<03e0>his two sons are fighting for the position.
Interesting, huh?
This has nothing to do with me.<03e0>I don't care.
...I'm sure they don't care about you, either.
They say that if you listen closely, you can<03e0>hear crying coming from the depths of<03e0>the Great Sand Sea.
Interesting, huh?
Crying? Someone's hurting?<03e0>How...tragic...
...Are you laughing?<03e0>...You're laughing, aren't you?
A long time ago, a hero lived in the Great Sand Sea.
Interesting, huh?
And?
...I don't know.
Some guy got the wits scared out of him in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea. He was talking to a pillar<03e0>when ghosts appeared out of nowhere.
Interesting, huh?
Guys who talk to pillars scare me more<03e0>than ghosts.
...True.
There's a man claiming to be a scientist<03e0>in Melphina. Apparently, we should stay away<03e0>from him because he's absolutely looney.
Interesting, huh?
Oh, that guy.
...A friend of yours?
There's a cafe in some city that's infested<03e0>with bugs from the desert. I hear the owner<03e0>is about to go crazy!
Interesting, huh?
How unsanitary.<03e0>I'm never going there.
Since the incident, Nagapur's become a real<03e0>dangerous area. There's lots of crime, especially<03e0>involving the kidnapping of young boys and girls.
Interesting, huh?
Kidnapping? Missing children?<03e0>That's just wrong!
A trend started in Royotia, where people would<03e0>exchange treasures they found on their adventures.<03e0>No one does that anymore, though.
Interesting, huh?
They would exchange treasures?<03e0>The only thing I would exchange<03e0>treasure for is cash.
Balterossa is the sole buyer of all of<03e0>Royotia's trade goods. There are countless merchants<03e0>who aren't too happy with the situation.
Interesting, huh?
I'm sure they're being resold at a reasonable<03e0>price, unlike the inflated price tags<03e0>the merchants would put on them.
...You just made enemies with every<03e0>merchant in the world.
A yamaan mercenary is looking for soldiers to<03e0>help him out. I bet he found himself a job too big<03e0>to take on alone.
Interesting, huh?
Mercenaries don't have a steady earning.<03e0>He needs to change careers.<03e0>Deskwork is always a good option.
...With the ongoing feuds, I'm sure<03e0>they get paid better than you do.
I heard some girl raving about a man in Celapaleis<03e0>who's sweet one second, but then angry the next.<03e0>She says he's her ideal man. Women...
Interesting, huh?
That's my ideal man, too!
...Really?
There's a qsiti who stands in the middle<03e0>of busy streets and glares at anyone<03e0>who bumps into him. Weird.
Interesting, huh?
Oh, I know him.
...Another friend of yours?
There's this intriguingly mysterious lady<03e0>who looks like she has the weight<03e0>of the world on her shoulders.
Interesting, huh?
I should try acting mysterious.<03e0>Maybe then people will pay attention to me!
There was a bunch of Bloody Alice soldiers<03e0>spotted at the moor. It looked like they were<03e0>getting ready to do something big.
Interesting, huh?
Those feminist bandits?<03e0>I hope they get eaten alive by<03e0>some horrid monster.
The Jhana are now causing a ruckus in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea. Apparently, not even<03e0>the Gae Bolg can teach them a lesson.
Interesting, huh?
They never learn...<03e0>Just like men.
...I resent that.
The Silver Falcons say they're going to get rid<03e0>of the Jhana. They're so dependable.
Interesting, huh?
It's not really their fault they don't<03e0>learn. Their race survives by stealing<03e0>from people. They don't think on their own.
...How do you know this?
The Silver Falcons are going to get<03e0>rid of what's left of the Conqueror's army.<03e0>Good riddance!
Interesting, huh?
Less soldiers means less customers...<03e0>Ah well.
A real gloomy-looking man comes here all the time.<03e0>He really creeps me out...
Interesting, huh?
I want to kick him out, but I have no real reason to.
...No one knows anything about him.
