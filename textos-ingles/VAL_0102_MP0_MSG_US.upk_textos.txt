This is Balterossa's famed shopping area,<03e0>Spirale Market. It's named for how the path<03e0>twists around the Remnant Tao Tie.<04e0>Here you can buy the finest weapons from<03e0>across the continent, and pick up the rarest<03e0>components...everything you could ever need!

Once we learned Lady Bertrude had fallen ill,<03e0>we merchants started bringing in the best<03e0>tonics and medicines from across the continent.<04e0>The Duchess is an incredibly strong woman,<03e0>taking care of Balterossa single-handedly after<03e0>her husband passed. She is much admired.<04e0>If the famed trade routes of Balterossa are able<03e0>to save her life, I can't think of anything more<03e0>appropriate.

About a half a year ago, some legion of<03e0>monsters drew out the army... While they were<03e0>attacking, the Conqueror grabbed the Tao Tie!<04e0>The Tao Tie was the soul of Spirale Market.<03e0>Since it's been gone, we don't get too many<03e0>shoppers out, plus it just feels colder all around.

South of the Great Sand Sea is the mining city<03e0>of Royotia. The gems and ore they mine are<03e0>exclusively sold here in Balterossa.<04e0>Balterossa is rich both economically and<03e0>culturally<07f0>being a major trade hub attracts<03e0>people from all over. <04e0>As a Balterossan, I consider it a point of pride.<03e0>However, to put it plainly, the Royotians are<03e0>incredibly jealous of our fortune.

The Silver Falcons have received some<03e0>troubling information from Intelligence...<04e0>Some entity is attempting to take advantage of<03e0>the Duchess's illness to inflame relations<03e0>between Balterossa and Royotia.<04e0>By the name of the Silver Falcons, we will do<03e0>our best to avoid war at any cost.

Once the Falcons learned the Conqueror had<03e0>invaded the city, we returned from fighting the<03e0>monster hordes as soon as we could.<04e0>But it was too late. The Tao Tie was gone, and<03e0>the only thing left was the man in red.<04e0>We all rushed him, but to no avail. He took our<03e0>every attack without even a scratch. It was a<03e0>shaming day for the Falcons...<04e0>Against that man in red, we were completely<03e0>ineffective...

It's amazing that we can have such a bustling<03e0>city in the middle of the desert, isn't it? It's<03e0>all due to the blessing of the Tao Tie.<04e0>Go on, take a look. It's like two giant insects,<03e0>isn't it? Those sweet beasties take care of all<03e0>Balterossa.

Hello, dearie. Just look at that. When I was just<03e0>a little girl, I was so afraid of the Tao Tie...<03e0>I thought it was a monster out to eat me up!<04e0>Still, I was drawn to its shimmer and would gaze<03e0>at it for hours. I can't quite say I've ever<03e0>shaken the habit!<04e0>But recently, it's seemed a little strange. Every<03e0>so often, the Tao Tie seems to lose its shine...<03e0>Like its heart had gone cold.<04e0>Ahh, perhaps it's just the ramblings of an old<03e0>biddy... I hope that's all it is, at least.

Calling Remnants our guardian angels is just a<03e0>self-serving nickname... In the end, it's far from<03e0>the truth.<04e0>I heard that some large foreign city was destroyed<03e0>when their Remnant went wild. Everything, everyone,<03e0>gone, just like that.<04e0>Too much power will only lead to destruction. Perhaps<03e0>it's for the best that the Tao Tie was taken away.

What? Do you need something?
Do you need something?
Have you seen Lord David?<04e0>I do not feel comfortable letting him alone.<03e0>If you see him, please tell him I am looking for him.
What a troublemaker...
...
On the surface, it does not seem like this place<03e0>has changed very much...<04e0>That said, it is no place to let Lord David run about<03e0>unsupervised. If you see him, tell him I am looking<03e0>for him.
You haven't seen Lord David?
If it was only going to be stolen anyway, we should<03e0>have taken the Remnant ourselves...<04e0>...No, Lord David would never have stood for it.
Please forget I said anything.
The Remnant Ark...<03e0>Surely there must be a similar Remnant elsewhere<03e0>in the world...
I can think of nothing...
Lord David is as prepared as he can be.<04e0>All I have to do is follow.
Ahh... What a spectacular Remnant.<03e0>It just has a certain impact, doesn't it?<03e0>I feel as if I'd never tire of looking at it...<04e0>However... The pair of them don't seem to get along<03e0>all that well, do they...
Incredible...
...
After learning of Remnants disappearing the world over,<03e0>I'd become a bit wary, but look. This place is the same<03e0>as always...it's a small but appreciated blessing.
Yes, yes.
Then, it's just like Athlum...<04e0>The whole mood of the town is different.
What in the world is going on?
It must exist, somewhere...
Let's continue to search.
Let's finish this...learn the true ending of this tale.
Come and check out the weapons they have!<03e0>Ahh, from blunt to sharp, fancy decorative stuff<03e0>to everyday weapons, I love 'em all!
Heheheheh...
Lady Emma...
Heya, Rush! Check it out<07f0>the Remnant's still alive<03e0>and kicking! So we can't get all down either, right?
We can't lose hope now!
Even the weapons seem kinda pooped out...<03e0>Guess it's 'coz the Remnant's gone...
Geez, even the weapons seem pooped out...
Gah, if I have to think about this Remnant stuff any<03e0>more, my head's gonna explode! You just tell me<03e0>where to go when you've figured it out, okay?
I'm ready to rock whenever!
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>Don't worry<07f0>I'll knock down anybody in our way!
What am I doing?<04e0>Just as it looks, taking a walk. As the Marquis,<03e0>I can't just roam the streets alone in Athlum or<03e0>Celapaleis...<04e0>I'm certain Torgal is having conniptions, but let's<03e0>keep this between us, shall we?
Remember, this is our secret.
It seems the Tao Tie is still untouched...
...
Balterossa as well...<04e0>Then, Athlum is not the only victim...
...
What am I rushing around for?<03e0>To be honest, I was mainly trying not to be recognized...
I hope we're not too late...
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>And we'll return together<07f0>victorious!
The town may look the same as always, but that's<03e0>only at first glance.<04e0>There's plenty of rumbling beneath the surface...<03e0>This is no time to start slacking.
This place is rotten...
They've lost their Remnant as well...<03e0>I suppose it could be just coincidence...<04e0>Certainly seems like a plot, though...
I can't believe someone isn't behind all this...
Hey now, quit playing around and help us search,<03e0>will you?  There's got to be another way to get to<03e0>the Sacred Lands, but we won't find it if you don't look.
Don't worry<07f0>we'll find it.
I'll look after Lord David since she cannot...<03e0>So you'd better do the same for Irina.
