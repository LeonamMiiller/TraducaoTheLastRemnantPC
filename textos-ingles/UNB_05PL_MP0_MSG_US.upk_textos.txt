Welcome to the Blessed Chime!
Welcome to the Blessed Chime!<04e0>You wish for an audience with the God Emperor?<04e0>Oh my. Only the most important of people are allowed<03e0>an audience with his majesty.<04e0>I'm afraid you're asking the impossible.
Hey, it's you!<03e0>Long time no see, sonny.<04e0>Thanks to your help, that monster on Mt. Vackel's<03e0>gone, so ah could finally come on home.<04e0>Can't believe you whupped that giant beast!<03e0>You've earned my respect for a lifetime.
It's hard to believe you defeated<03e0>such a gigantic monster!<03e0>You are a true hero!
Undelwalt was once the most prosperous<03e0>city in the world until the God Emperor<03e0>became nothing more than a figurehead.<04e0>It pains me to think about it.
The Blessed Chime has been around<03e0>since the days of the Imperator.<03e0>This place holds history.<04e0>The customers who used to come here<03e0>were very refined. You can't tell from<03e0>looking around the place today, though.
The Harmonium used to sparkle as it<03e0>reflected sunlight off its sides.<03e0>It was a beautiful sight.<04e0>Now it's covered in a greenish tint.<03e0>It could mean the Harmonium's bind<03e0>is coming to an end.
Imperial city, my ass!<03e0>It's pretty to look at, but it's empty inside.<04e0>Kinda like the God Emperor himself.
There is nothing to talk about today.
That is not true.<03e0>There is always love and compassion.
It seems the wife of Celapaleis's Baron Nielsen has<03e0>left him again. Their stormy relationship has been<03e0>well-known for ages.
This is the talk of the town, my lady.
Perhaps she'll come here for a chat!
Indeed.

The case has solved itself.<03e0>It was the suspicious woman!
Indeed.
The princess of a desert kingdom is in love<03e0>and sneaks out of the castle frequently.<03e0>People pray she does not get herself into any trouble.

Indeed.
It is rumored that in a certain moor,<03e0>the Imperator used his powers to<03e0>seal the entranceway to another realm.

Indeed.
Any Forest Maiden that vows eternity<03e0>with a Melphinian knight gains the power of<03e0>seeing and hearing everything her partner does.
This is the talk of the town, my lady.

I would like to attend this festival.<03e0>Perhaps if I leave now, they will put<03e0>it on hold till I arrive.
Indeed.
The Cosmos Maiden has arrived and the festival will<03e0>begin shortly. It is a shame that the tranquil<03e0>event is always disrupted by monsters.
This is the talk of the town, my lady.
Why would the monsters do that?<03e0>Who would try to ruin a perfectly<03e0>wonderful evening?
Indeed.
An old-fashioned woman is seeking<03e0>a bodyguard. She waits in the pub in<03e0>the town with the canals.

Indeed.
The treasures from different lands bestowed<03e0>upon the holy city have been stolen and<03e0>are being sold on the black market.

Indeed.
A lad is searching for the goddess statue in<03e0>the Robelia Ruins that supposedly lets one<03e0>reunite with someone far away.
