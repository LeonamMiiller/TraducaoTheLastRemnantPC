Hey<07f0>hey kid. Got a minute?<06e0000008e0000000000000>What's up?<09e008e0010000000000>Not if you need a favor.
Okay, the job's real simple. I just need you to<03e0>find a girl and bring her here to town.<04e0>See, everyone in town's getting ready for a big<03e0>celebration called the Kosmosfest.<04e0>It's an ancient festival that's been held for<03e0>hundreds of years. However, for some reason<03e0>this year's Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it yet.<04e0>Folks in town have started wondering if she's<03e0>okay, but we're so busy getting things ready<03e0>that we don't have time to go look for her.<04e0>So, I'd like you to go out and find the Cosmos<03e0>Maiden for us.<04e0>I mean, she probably just left late, or is<03e0>traveling kinda leisurely, something like that,<03e0>but you never know if she ran into monsters...<04e0>Anyhow, we're sort of in a hurry, right? So, will<03e0>you help us out?<06e0000008e0000000000000>I'll get your maiden back safe!<09e008e0010000000300>Sorry, not interested...
It's not even that troublesome of a favor...<03e0>Well, if you change your mind, let me know.
Great! I really appreciate it.<04e0>I'm sure she just got caught up somewhere<03e0>along the way... Probably <1be0ffbe34ff>Crookfen<1ce0>. Try looking<03e0>around there, would you?
Oh...<03e0>Guess you've got stuff to do as well, right?<04e0>Well, I guess we'll figure something out. Sorry<03e0>for springing this on you out of the blue.
Most likely the Cosmos Maiden's gotten lost in<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Crookfen<1ce0>, north of Melphina.<04e0>She could've gotten caught up in something,<03e0>maybe something bad... Please, find her and<03e0>make sure she's alright, okay?
What, you changed your mind<07f0>you can go find<03e0>the Cosmos Maiden for us?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Sure. See you in a bit.<09e008e0010000000300>I was just saying hi...
Great! I really appreciate it.<04e0>I'm sure she just got caught up somewhere<03e0>along the way... Probably <1be0ffbe34ff>Crookfen<1ce0>. Try looking<03e0>around there, would you?
Oh... Sorry, you had me getting my hopes up.<03e0>Well, with all the stuff I've gotta do, guess I<03e0>can't complain about others being busy.
Heyyy, it's you! Finally, I've been waiting for you to<03e0>come back!<04e0>The Cosmos Maiden just showed up a minute ago,<03e0>safe and sound. She made it in time for the festival.<03e0>What a load off my chest!<04e0>Though I figured you'd come in together...<03e0>You get split up or something?<04e0>Ah, whatever, whatever, no biggie. The point is,<03e0>you totally saved me and the festival<07f0>thanks.<03e0>Take this.
Alright... Guess I'd better get back to work.<03e0>There's still so much to do for the festival...<03e0>We'll be burning the midnight oil on this one.<04e0>I've gotta run, but thanks again! And make<03e0>sure you come back for the Kosmosfest,<03e0>alright?
Traditionally, they pick a girl from Melphina to<03e0>be the maiden of the Kosmosfest.<04e0>They always choose really cute girls, so I'm<03e0>totally looking forward to seeing this year's...<03e0>Man, what's taking her so long?
Kosmosfest is a celebration for the people.<03e0>The Cosmos Maiden wishes for world peace<03e0>by binding the Remnant Syltique.<04e0>If she can successfully bind the Remnant, the<03e0>following year will be peaceful... At least,<03e0>that's how the story goes.<04e0>Lately, the world's been in a crazy state, so I<03e0>can only hope this year's binding works out.
After the festival, all kinds of crazies start<03e0>imitating the Cosmos Maiden, praying all willy-<03e0>nilly and whatnot. What a bunch of maroons!<04e0>...That said, if the people here weren't such<03e0>simpletons, we wouldn't get a festival at a<03e0>time like this, I suppose.
This year, the Cosmos Maiden's s'posed ta be<03e0>coming down from Melphina all by her<03e0>lonesome.<04e0>They say it's a test of her trainin'<07f0>ta see if<03e0>she's properly learnt her mystic arts or not.
Ahh, when it comes down to it, the whole<03e0>festival's just like a good luck charm, you<03e0>know?<04e0>Back in the day, it was actually a symbol of<03e0>peace... Things sure have changed.
