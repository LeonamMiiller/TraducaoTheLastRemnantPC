[Remnants 1]<03e0>Remnants are mysterious objects<03e0>that hold powers beyond those of men.
[Remnants 2]<03e0>No one knows when or how Remnants<03e0>were created.
[Remnants 3]<03e0>Men have used Remnants as<03e0>beneficial tools since ancient times.
[Remnants 4]<03e0>Towns and kingdoms were built<03e0>around Remnants with strong powers.
[Remnants 5]<03e0>The Imperial City of Undelwalt was<03e0>the first to be built around a Remnant.
[Remnants 6]<03e0>A powerful Remnant can affect even<03e0>the environment around it.
[Remnants 7]<03e0>It is said that a Remnant once caused a flourishing<03e0>city in the Great Sand Sea to fall into ruin.
[Remnants 8]<03e0>In order to use the powers of a Remnant,<03e0>one must bind it to himself.
[Remnants 9]<03e0>To bind a Remnant, one simply needs to<03e0>place a hand over the Remnant and concentrate.
[Remnants 10]<03e0>However, a Remnant can only be bound<03e0>during its Luminescence.
[Remnants 11]<03e0>Luminescence is a natural occurence<03e0>that causes light to emit from a Remnant.
[Remnants 12]<03e0>Luminescence occurs in a cycle,<03e0>the length differing for each Remnant.
[Remnants 13]<03e0>A short cycle can be a few minutes,<03e0>while a long cycle can take years.
[Remnants 14]<03e0>One known Luminescence cycle is<03e0>that of the Remnant Ark: three months.
[Remnants 15]<03e0>No one knows why Luminescence<03e0>occurs. Perhaps it is a signal.
[Remnants 16]<03e0>If a Remnant is bound to someone,<03e0>it cannot be bound by anyone else.
[Remnants 17]<03e0>A bound Remnant can only be operated<03e0>by whom it is bound to.
[Remnants 18]<03e0>An unbound Remnant is called<03e0>a Blank Remnant.
[Remnants 19]<03e0>A Collapse is a misfortune triggered by a<03e0>Blank Remnant being unbound for too long.
[Remnants 20]<03e0>The most common effect of a Collapse<03e0>is the spawning of monsters.
[Remnants 21]<03e0>Some forms of Collapse are said<03e0>to affect people's minds.
[Remnants 22]<03e0>Operating a Remnant wears away<03e0>at the operator's soul.
[Remnants 23]<03e0>The core Remnants of each town<03e0>are bound by the town's Lord.
[Remnants 24]<03e0>The Remnant Elysion is currently<03e0>unbound.
[Remnants 25]<03e0>A lord bound to a core Remnant is said<03e0>to have a shorter lifespan than others.
[Remnants 26]<03e0>A Remnant's size does not relate to its strength,<03e0>though the core Remnants have great powers.
[Remnants 27]<03e0>It is inferred that all Remnants were<03e0>created from Elysion.
[Remnants 28]<03e0>Remnants constantly emit resonating waves.
[Remnants 29]<03e0>Remnants are made from an unknown<03e0>substance, unaffected by space or time.
[Remnants 30]<03e0>An unproven theory suggests that<03e0>Remnants are a type of life form.
[The Marshalls 1]<03e0>The Marshalls were an ancient clan,<03e0>infamous for their mysterious powers.
[The Marshalls 2]<03e0>A Marshall did not need a focus<03e0>object to use mystic arts.
[The Marshalls 3]<03e0>The Marshalls used magick, an ancient<03e0>ability that has long been forgotten.
[The Marshalls 4]<03e0>The Marshalls were said to have<03e0>developed many fantastic techniques.
[The Marshalls 5]<03e0>The tablet discovered in Marshallton is one of<03e0>the last surviving relics of the Marshalls' skills.
[The Marshalls 6]<03e0>The Marshall tablet holds the power to seal<03e0>and transform a Remnant into a talisman.
[The Marshalls 7]<03e0>While all such transformed Remnants are called<03e0>talismans, the exact forms they take on differ.
[The Marshalls 8]<03e0>In the form of a talisman, a Remnant<03e0>will not trigger a Collapse.
[The Marshalls 9]<03e0>A Remnant in talisman form can be used<03e0>by anyone. It does not need to be bound.
[The Marshalls 10]<03e0>The Marshalls disappeared from history<03e0>with the age of the Imperator.
[The Third Committee 1]<03e0>The Third Committee is an Academy organization<03e0>that conducts illegal Remnant experiments.

[The Third Committee 5]<03e0>Project BA:<03e0>Fusion of a Remnant with a mitra
[World Races 1]<03e0>There are four main races in the world:<03e0>mitra, yama, qsiti, and sovani.

Wha<07f0>for real?
I really wanted this!
Great!
Yay! I've got them all!
Oh man...
This is nice.
This is exactly what I needed.
And that's the last of them.
...Perhaps next time.
Hmm.
At last.
Excellent.
Hmph.
Finally, I've found it.
I've been looking for this.
Oho, that's the full set.
*sigh*
Ooh, this's the one!
Ha! Got it!
Yeahhh! Caught 'em all!
Whaaat? No fair!
Oh! I've found it.
Yes...this is what I've needed!
Wonderful! Now I've collected them all.
Ahh... A pity.
If there is no objection, I shall take this.
At last, it is mine.
I was able to gather them all.
Hmph... Fine; I can wait.
There you are.
This is just what I needed.
That should be the last of them.
Hmph, do as you like.
I'll take this!
All according to plan.
And that's everything I needed!
Oh no... How could you...
I'll be takin' that.
Had my eye on this for a while.
Huhhh, looks like a full set.
Keh, what's that all about?
Oh yes...it's as if it were made for me!
With this, I need nothing else.
Marvelous...with this piece, I have finished my collection!
I cannot believe such an affront!
I wanted this! ...I think.
I was looking for this! ...Right?
Then that's all the components I needed! ...Right?
Now that I think of it, maybe I didn't need that after all...
Will you entrust this item to my care?
I have received a good thing.
Good. My preparations are complete.
Regrettable, but I can endure.
Of course I'll be takin' that.
Hell yeah! I got it!
And that's the whole shebang.
Dammit! That was mine!
I understand this is to be mine?
I've hoped to acquire this.
I've gained all the components I need!
Ah... He who hesitates is lost.
You'll let me have this, right?
I got it.
That's the last of them, thank goodness!
I-I didn't get it? Oh...
Hmm, this is nice.
I'd hoped to get this.
And now my components are complete!
Next time, then.
Goodness, is this for me?
Thank you.
Hmm? It seems that's the last component I needed.
*sigh* Well, maybe next time.
I'll be taking this.
Ehh, not too shabby.
Huhhh, looks like a full set.
Gimme a break!
Like, this is mine!
*giggle*
Sweet, I totally got them all!
Oh my god emperor, you totally didn't need that half as much as I did.
Alright, hand it over.
Got it!
Heh, that's the end of 'em.
Somebody's feeling ballsy.
Oh! That's it!
Lucky me!
Yay! I've got them all!
Oh poo.
I'll be takin' my reward, then.
Good, good.
Finally, I've got the last of 'em.
It's orders, so I'll suck it up...
If nobody else needs it, guess I'll take it.
This thing, huh?
Hmph, looks like that's the last of 'em.
I'll remember that...
Mm-hmm!
This is of great importance.
Ahh...I see I've collected all I need.
Hrm...
I'll take this, thanks.
Thank the Emperor I got this.
Good. I shouldn't need any more components now.
...Guess I'll get the next one.
Yoink! You get nothing! Faced!!!
Ohohohohohohoho!
Yeahhh, who got 'em all, who da man?
Whaaat? You cheating-y cheater!
I can take this, right?
Finally.
Ehh, that didn't take TOO long.
Whaddaya mean, I can't have it?
I want this! I mean, if it's okay...
Yay!
Yay, I got all my components!
Oh...fiddlesticks!
I assume this will be mine?
Eureka!
Brilliant. This is the last component I needed.
Hrm...
Hand it over.
Perfect.
That's the last of them.
Hmph.
I may take this?
We must use this the way it was meant to be used.
At last, I can craft better equipment.
It is of little concern to me.
What am I to do with this?
I'll take this if I must.
Hmm. It seems my collection is complete.
I need nothing.
Heheh, finally, something decent.
Yes...yes! YES!!!
Heheh, one more thing to kill with.
Who took it! Tell me so I can wring your neck!
...Taking this.
...That's the last of them.
...New equipment, huh?
...
I'll take that!
Nice!
Hey, now I can upgrade my stuff!
Grr...
Let me have it!
That's all of them, right?
Awesome! Now I can upgrade my stuff!
Wh-what? I wanted that...
Fork over the loot!
Yeah! That's all of 'em!
Awright! Upgrade time!
Oh, gimme a freaking break!
If you'll allow me to take this...
Excellent.
And with this, I may become stronger.
How could this be happening?
...I'll take this.
...That's the full set.
...Upgrade-ready.
Rrgh...
I'll take that!
Heyyy, got another one.
Great, now I can upgrade my equipment.
Ahh...
Dibs!
Got another one!
Yes! Got a full set!
Ehh? That was so mine...
Outta the way, kids.
Ha ha ha ha!
Hah! My gear's gonna be so badass!
Oh, come on.
Thank you.
Hee hee...another one done.
Another step along the path to true strength.
Unbelievable...
Only someone of my beauty is worthy of this!
This is it!
Wonderful! This will only add to my beauty!
What? You hideous beast!
Me... Me want...
Me... Me get...
Me... Me make...
What!? You're just askin' to die!
Can I?
Hehe... I've got them all!
Hehe... I'll play you a new tune.

Thank you.
I wanted this.
Don't make me hurt you.
Hm.

Rush, can we talk? I've been wondering if<03e0>I should be focusing my training more...
Being well-rounded is the best.

Focus on combat!
Combat arts, huh?<03e0>You just wanna see me as a brawler...<03e0>Soon I'll be able to beat you up!

Sure, no prob.
Thank you...I appreciate it.
Ehh... I need this for now.
...I see.
Rush, if you're free, let's fight a bit outside<03e0>of town. I have to admit I'm feeling a bit rusty...
Aww, I can't say no to you.
Perfect. Then let's head out.
No.
I-I see...<03e0>I'll do my best not to falter in the field, then...
Hmm... Learn the new spell <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or stick with what I've already been learning?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?

Alright. Hopefully it will prove a good addition<03e0>to our repertoire.
Go with what you know.

Rush, do you have a moment?<03e0>I've been wondering how I should focus my<03e0>training, and I'd like your opinion.
Be an all 'rounder.
I see... Certainly, I wouldn't have to worry<03e0>about a particular weakness then.
Combat arts, for sure!
Ahh, I thought you'd say that.<03e0>There is something to be said for brains over<03e0>brawn...nothing wrong with brawn, though.
Definitely mystic arts!
Mmm, you have a point, mastering mystic arts<03e0>is a powerful and useful skill.
Rush... What should I focus on for training?<03e0>To be a good leader, I need to know as<03e0>much as I can.
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Ahh...I see.<03e0>Thank you...I can walk my path clearly with this.

Sure, no prob.
Appreciated. It'll be used hard, but used well.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...Is that so.
Say, Rush, you look unoccupied.<03e0>How about we pick up some battles, hmm?<03e0>Just a little something to work the kinks out.
Sounds like a plan.
Oho? You surprised me.<03e0>I didn't think you'd be up for any fun.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Tsk, figured as much.<03e0>All play and no work...
Hmm... The spell <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Is it worth the time to learn it? Or ought I just stick with<03e0>what I already know?
Don't run from a challenge!
A challenge, hmm? Fine, I'll give it a shot.
Go with what you know.
Good point.<03e0>Then I'll focus on the spells I already have.
You've gotta decide that.
Hm! I suppose you have a point there.<03e0>No point in living if you can't trust in yourself.
Hmm... Learn the new technique <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or stick with what I already know?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?

A challenge, hmm? Fine, I'll give it a shot.
New tricks? Not for old dogs!
Funny. My old tricks are more than enough<03e0>to keep you from any more lippy remarks.
You gotta choose for yourself.
Hm! I suppose you have a point there.<03e0>No point in living if you can't trust in yourself.
Rush, do you have a moment? I can't quite<03e0>decide how I should focus my training.
All-rounder, natch.
Hmm... I do like the idea of not being poor at<03e0>anything in particular.
Combat arts, for sure!
Ahh...<03e0>For what is a knight without a skill for combat?
Definitely mystic arts!
Ahh... Mystic arts are useful skills.
Rush... What should I focus on for training?<03e0>I thought I'd decided, but I'm less certain than<03e0>I thought...
Balance is the key.
Heh... I think this talk was just what I needed.<03e0>I won't be wasting time worrying about this again.
Combat arts suit you 110%.

Alrighty!

I see...<03e0>Creep.

Sure, no prob.
Really?<03e0>I appreciate it.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...Snitty comments like that aren't going to win<03e0>you any points with your sister.
Say, Rush. I'm getting antsy...<03e0>What say we pick up some battles, hmm?
Sounds like a plan.
That's what I like to hear. C'mon!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Ah, too bad.
Hey, Rush. I've been thinking about learning<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>What do you think?
Go for it!
You think? I don't know how useful it'll be,<03e0>but you never know until you try, right?
Nah, focus on what you've got.
Good point. Then I'll try and polish up what I<03e0>know so I can learn more powerful spells.
You gotta choose for yourself.
You've got a point... Kinda stings coming<03e0>from a kid like you, though!

Rush, how do you think I should focus my<03e0>training? I've been feeling a little uncertain<03e0>about it...
A little of everything's good.
Hmm... Maybe you have a point.
Combat arts, for sure!
Ahh... Combat is important.
Definitely mystic arts!
Ahh... Mystic arts are useful skills.

Okay!

Whoa, that <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>you've got is pretty sweet. Think I could borrow it?
Sure, no prob.
For real? Appreciate it, man.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Boo to that.
Heya, Rush! I bet you're bored like me...<03e0>How 'bout we go do some fighting, show<03e0>some monsters who's boss, eh?
Sounds like a plan.
Yeahh, that's more like it! C'mon!
Sorry... Maybe next time.
Aw, why you gotta be so cold?
So I was thinking of learning<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Whadda you think, Rush?
Go for it!
Alright.<03e0>It'll definitely be a challenge, but that's not<03e0>gonna stop me!
Nah, focus on what you've got.
Okay! I'll keep trainin' what I got and learn<03e0>some real kickass spells!
That decision's all up to you.
Ouch...that's harsh, man.

You should go for balance.
Huh, that sounds good.<03e0>Then I could do anything!
Combat arts, for sure!
Oh yeah. That's definitely my style, huh?
Definitely mystic arts!
You think so? Well, I'll do my best.
Hey, Rush, what do you think I should focus<03e0>my training on? I'm worried I'm holding<03e0>the others back...
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Yeah... It suits me, too, I think.<03e0>Awright, no more of this wishy-washy bull.<03e0>Let's go, Rush!
Combat arts suit you 110%.

Sure.
Excellent! Then let's get a move on.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Rush, would you lend me your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>for a while?
Sure, no prob.
So generous! I appreciate it.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
I never imagined you so petty...
Oh, Rush. If you've some free time, why<03e0>don't we fight a bit outside of town?<03e0>Sitting around all day isn't good for you...
Yeah, let's hit it!
As I expected from you! Let's be off!
Kinda busy, sorry.
Hum... Slack on your training and you'll find<03e0>your body rebelling when you really need it.
Hmm... Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue polishing what I know?<03e0>I'm curious, Rush, what do you think?
Try something new!
Hmm! I always have loved learning.
Focus on what you know.
Jack-of-all-trades, master of none, as they<03e0>say...<03e0>Then I'll work on mastering the areas I do know.
That decision's all up to you.
I tip my hat to you... It's just as you say.

I tip my hat to you... It's just as you say.
Rush, what do you think I should focus on?<03e0>Is it really enough to maximize my command<03e0>of mystic arts?
Learn a little bit of everything.
I see...<03e0>I suppose that would avoid being too one-sided.
Combat arts, for sure!
I see... Combat arts are quite dependable.
Definitely mystic arts!
Exactly! Goodness, look at me, doing all this<03e0>worrying over nothing...
Rush, what do you think I should focus on?<03e0>I fear I'm not able to help the others as I should...

Sorry...maybe later.
I see.
Would you allow me to borrow your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?
Sure, no prob.
Thank you.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
Do we have time to engage some monsters?<03e0>It would not do to slack on training.
Sounds like a plan.
Mm. Let's go.
Kinda busy, sorry.
You'll never become stronger with that attitude.
To learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>I've found I cannot decide whether it's worth taking<03e0>energy from my current disciplines.
Go for it!
Heh. Of course.
Focus on what you've got!
Then I shall concentrate on higher-level<03e0>spells in the areas I already study.
You should choose, not me.
Oho... You're full of surprises.
To learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>I've found I cannot decide whether it's worth taking<03e0>energy from my current disciplines.
Go for it!
Heh. Of course.
Just polish what you've got.
Then I shall concentrate on higher-level<03e0>techniques in the areas I already study.
You should decide.
Oho... You're full of surprises.
Am I properly focusing my training? In times<03e0>like this, my lack of discipline could be the<03e0>difference between success and failure for Athlum...
You should go for balance.
Certainly that is the best path for a sovani...
Combat arts, for sure!
Becoming a specialist in man-to-man combat,<03e0>then? Certainly not a bad thing...
Definitely mystic arts!
Focusing the spirit... I admit, this is my personal<03e0>preference.
I wonder... Is there a way I can focus my training to<03e0>be more effective? There must be a way to be more<03e0>helpful to Lord David...
Balance is the key.
Yes... Then, the road before me is clear.<03e0>I'll go forward...for Athlum.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Yes... Then, the road before me is clear.<03e0>I'll go forward...for Athlum.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Yes... Then, the road before me is clear.<03e0>I'll go forward...for Athlum.
There's something I need, young one<07f003e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Come with me to find it.
Okay, sure.
Good. Let's head out.
Sorry...maybe later.
Harumph.
Young one, your<1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>I'd like to put it to good use...
It's all yours.
Appreciated.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Harumph.
You look free, young one.<03e0>Instead of wasting time here, we should hit<03e0>the battlefield!
Sounds like a plan.
Then, follow me.
Kinda busy, sorry.
And you wonder why you're so weak.
Hmm... Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue polishing what I know?<03e0>What's the wiser choice?
Don't run from a challenge!
A challenge, hmm? Fine, I'll give it a shot.
Go with what you know.
Hum. As I'd decided from the start.<03e0>After a bit more practice, I'll show you some<03e0>truly amazing spells.
You gotta choose for yourself.
You don't know either, do you...
Hmm... Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue polishing what I know?<03e0>What's the wiser choice?
Don't run from a challenge!
A challenge, hmm? Fine, I'll give it a shot.
Go with what you know.
Hum. As I'd decided from the start.<03e0>After a bit more practice, I'll show you some<03e0>truly amazing moves.
You should choose, not me.
You don't know either, do you...
What should I focus on from now on?<03e0>I'm not worried or anything, just curious...
Do it all!
That is an option...
Combat arts, for sure!
Mm... I, too, was thinking I would need to<03e0>become even stronger...
Definitely mystic arts!
Mmm... Mystic arts aren't anything to laugh at,<03e0>either, I suppose...
So... Where should I go from here?<03e0>I can only go forward, but in what direction?
Balance is the key.
Mmm... I see.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Mmm... I see.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Mmm... I see.
ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>That's what I need. Do you think we'd<03e0>have time to pick one up?
Sure, no prob.
Really? Great!<03e0>Let's get going!
Sorry...maybe later.
Oh? That's too bad.
Say, Rush, could I have a look at your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>for a little while? I'd like to conduct some testing...
Sure, no prob.
Are you sure? Thanks!
Ehh... I need it right now.
Ahh...
Rush, do you think we'd have some time to go<03e0>battle some? I think I'm on the verge of a<03e0>new discovery!
Sounds like a plan.
Great! Then let's go.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Ah, I see.<03e0>Maybe next time.
Should I start <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or stick with what I've already been learning?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
You think so? Alright. I'll do my best!
Go with what you know.
Ahh, I see.<03e0>Alright, I'll concentrate on the areas I<03e0>already study for now.
You should choose, not me.
I see... Let me give it some more thought.
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue to practice what I already know?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Alright!<03e0>This should be an interesting experiment...
Just polish what you've got.
Alright. I'll focus on the areas I know...<03e0>I'm sure there's a lot more knowledge to<03e0>be gleaned.
You should decide.
You have a point...<03e0>Let me put a little more thought into it.
Rush, what do you think I should be focusing<03e0>on? I've been a little worried, lately...
Being well-rounded is good!
Yes... If you can do a little of everything,<03e0>travel isn't much of an obstacle...
Combat arts, for sure!
When things get tough, that sort of strength<03e0>can be useful, I guess.
Definitely mystic arts!
Sounds helpful to Remnant research!
Say, Rush, what areas do you think I should<03e0>focus on? I'm curious to hear your opinion.
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Thank you, Rush. I'll take your opinion into<03e0>consideration and do my best!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush. I'll take your opinion into<03e0>consideration and do my best!
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Thank you, Rush. I'll take your opinion into<03e0>consideration and do my best!
What's good? I'm thinking we should get some<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>It'll be the jump-off.
Alrighty!
Word. Then let's roll.
Sorry, man, maybe later.
You're wyling.
Oh, so that <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>you got? You're gonna let me borrow it, right?
Sure, no prob.
Props, man. That's chill.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Punk.
You trying to get your battle on or something?<03e0>I like kicking ass, not sitting on it.
Yeah, I'm game.
Cool. Let's bounce then.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Pathetic.
So I guess I could learn<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>,<03e0>but it kinda sounds like a waste of time...
No way<07f0>go for it!
Alright. Then I'll try to get it down ASAP.
Yeah, I'd give it a pass.
Alright. Polishing what I already know ain't<03e0>gonna hurt anything.
I dunno... What do you think?
I think I asked you for your opinion...<03e0>Whatever.
Was thinking of learning<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Whadda you think?
Yeah, I'd go for it!
Alright. With some more arts under my belt<03e0>I'd be sick on the battlefield.
Nah, work on what you've got.
What, you think I'm fallin' off?<03e0>...Nah, I hear you. I need to lock down the<03e0>arts I already know.
Whatever you want.
Wow. How unhelpful.
What should I focus on from now on...<03e007f0>Eh? Just talking to myself, never mind.
All-rounder, natch.
Sounds quick and easy.
Combat arts, for sure!
Yeahhh...that sounds about right.
Definitely mystic arts!
Huh... Maybe.
Sup, Rush. I was just thinking about what<03e0>sort of training I should focus on...<03e0>Not that you gotta worry about that.
Balance is the key.
Mmm...<03e0>Sorry for underestimating you all this time.<03e0>From now on it's on!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Mmm...<03e0>Sorry for underestimating you all this time.<03e0>From now on it's on!
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Mmm...<03e0>Sorry for underestimating you all this time.<03e0>From now on it's on!
Rush, I need a favor... I am looking for the <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>I thought together we could find it, perhaps in the blink<03e0>of an eye.
Alrighty!
Really? You are a lifesaver.
Sorry...maybe later.
How unfortunate...
Your <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>is impressive... Yet it would be even more so in my<03e0>possession. What do you think?
...Sure, you can borrow it.
You have my eternal gratitude.<03e0>It shall be used spectacularly.
No, I need to hold onto it.
So cold... Believe me when I say that the ladies<03e0>prefer a man who is warm...if not blazing hot.
Rush... Shall we proceed to the field of battle<03e0>and wreak havoc upon the monster hordes?<03e0>I...must become someone she can depend on...
Sounds like a plan.
Excellent!<03e0>My arm sings with the promise of victory!
Busy now, sorry.
Do you truly think you will attract a lover<03e0>with an attitude like that?
I have the chance to add <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>to my repertoire... Should I?
Go for it!
I don't want to be known as a man afraid of<03e0>commitment... Yet I shall attempt this new<03e0>type of skill.
Nah, I'd give it a pass.
I see. Then I shall focus on what I already know.<03e0>Soon the most beautiful spells you have ever<03e0>seen shall be mine to command!
Whatever you want, dude.
You...you think I'm unreliable, don't you...
ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Should I begin to study it? Or focus on what I<03e0>already know?
Try something new!
A true man isn't tempted by every new face that<03e0>crosses his path... And yet there is something to<03e0>be said for...fresh experiences.
Just polish what you've got.
I see. Then I shall focus on what I already know.<03e0>Soon the most beautiful techniques you have ever<03e0>seen shall be mine to command!
Decide that for yourself.
I see... The answer lies within me, waiting for Fate<03e0>herself to pluck it from my tender breast...<03e0>I shall give her the time she needs.
What should I focus my training on? Alas, it is<03e0>too much for me to even select a single maid<03e0>to lay my affections on...
Being well-rounded is good!
I see... The best of both worlds, as it were.
Combat arts, for sure!
Combat, hm?<03e0>I suppose I am a bit of a swashbuckler.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells, hm?<03e0>I must admit, I am not poor at the mystic arts.
Rush Sykes! I know you see me as unreliable...<03e0>Thus, I ask you<07f0>what should I focus my training on?
All 'rounder is the way to go.
Ahh... Yes, you are right.<03e0>And now it is time I did what I must do.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Ahh... Yes, you are right.<03e0>And now it is time I did what I must do.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Ahh... Yes, you are right.<03e0>And now it is time I did what I must do.
Do you have a moment? Have you heard of<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I think I need one. Shall we search?
Sure, let's go.
Oho. You're a big help.
Sorry...maybe later.
Alright. I'm in no hurry.
What is that...<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Would you lend it to me for a while?
Sure, no prob.
Are you certain? I thank you.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
I feel like I'm getting dull and flabby...<03e0>Shall we fight some monsters for a bit?
Sounds like a plan.
I see you are also a fan of combat.
Kinda busy, sorry.
Ahh... You looked free... My mistake.
Hmm... Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue polishing what I know?<03e0>What's the wiser choice?
Try something new!
Yes...<03e0>Perhaps I could remember something I've lost...
Focus on what you've got!
Ahh... So, I should focus my training on becoming<03e0>more proficient in the areas I know.
You should decide.
Ah...I see.
Hmm... Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue polishing what I know?<03e0>What's the wiser choice?

Just polish what you've got.
Ahh... So, I should focus my training on becoming<03e0>more proficient in the areas I know.
You should decide.
Ah...I see.
What path should I follow from now on? I don't<03e0>even remember the one I took to get to this point...
All-rounder, natch.
Ahh... With that, no need to worry.
Combat arts, for sure!
My body should remember that...I hope.
Mystic arts, for sure.
My body should remember that...I hope.
What do you think I should focus on from<03e0>now on?<03e0>I value your opinion.
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Yes...yes.<03e0>I will keep this in mind as I go forward.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Yes...yes.<03e0>I will keep this in mind as I go forward.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Yes...yes.<03e0>I will keep this in mind as I go forward.
Master Sykes, might I trouble you for a moment?<03e0>I seek a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>,<03e0>and hoped that you might assist me in obtaining one.
Sure, let's go.
As always, I appreciate your help.
Sorry...maybe later.
Understood... A pity.
Master Sykes, might you be willing to lend me your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?
No prob!
Ohh!<03e0>As always, I appreciate your generosity.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
I never thought<07f003e0>Ah, nothing. Forget I said anything.
Master Sykes, would you accompany me to<03e0>the nearest battlefield? Even at this age,<03e0>it is poor form to shirk one's training.
Yeah, let's go!
I appreciate your indulgence.<03e0>Let us go at once.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Shall I attempt to learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>or focus on areas I already know? At this age,<03e0>it's no small matter to make a decision either way...
Try something new!
You are right...<03e0>I am far too old for pusillanimity!
Stick to what you know.
Understood. I shall focus my training on<03e0>proceeding further down the paths of<03e0>the mystic arts I already know.
You should decide.
Touché. Forgive my show of weakness...<03e0>You are truly wise beyond your years.

You should decide.
Touché. Forgive my show of weakness...<03e0>You are truly wise beyond your years.
How should I focus my training from now on?<03e0>I've found myself plagued with uncertainties<03e0>of late, thus I'd value your opinion, Master Sykes.
All-rounder, natch.
There is truth to your words...<03e0>A knight must be able to perform any task.
Combat arts, for sure!
A knight without a proper command of<03e0>combat arts is but a disgrace.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells can be useful tools in saving lives.
Master Sykes, do you think there's a better way I<03e0>could be focusing my training? Even at this age,<03e0>I sometimes wonder...
Balance is the key.
I am prepared.<03e0>As a knight of the Order of Melphina, I will<03e0>act proudly and without shame.
Combat arts is the way to go.
I am prepared. As a knight of the Order of<03e0>Melphina, I will act proudly and without<03e0>shame.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
I am prepared. As a knight of the Order of<03e0>Melphina, I will act proudly and without<03e0>shame.
Hey, I need some <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>If you got time to sit around and talk, you've<03e0>got time to go get some eh?
Yeah, let's go.
Arright. C'mon.
Sorry...maybe later.
Ah. Don't wanna be seen with me, eh?<03e0>Don't blame you.
So, how about your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Why don'tcha let me take care of it for a while?
Sure, no prob.
F'r real? You're alright.
I kinda need it right now.
And this is why I hate people.
All this sitting around is making me nervous...<03e0>What say we pick up some battles, hmm?
Sounds like a plan.
Good. Let's go.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
*snort*
Guess I could learn<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>,<03e0>but it sounds like a waste of time...
No way<07f0>go for it!
Huh. Guess I'll see if it's useful after all.
Yeah, I'd give it a pass.
Polish up what I already got, eh?
You should decide.
...Right. Forget I asked.
Was thinking of learning<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Whadda you think?
Yeah, I'd go for it!
Alright. I'll give it a go.
Nah, work on what you've got.
Polish up what I already got, eh?
You should decide.
...Right. Forget I asked.
Hey. You think I'm trainin' in the right things?<03e0>...Ridiculous, ain't it? A bandit worrying about<03e0>this type of stuff...
Being well-rounded is good!
Yeah?<03e0>Guess there ain't no weakness in that.
Combat arts, for sure!
Yeah?<03e0>Guess I'm pretty used to hefting weapons<03e0>around.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Yeah... I saw the usefulness of mystic arts<03e0>firsthand when I was actively banditing.
So, whadda you think I should be training in?<03e0>Wanna know what you think.
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Okay. For Reya... And, for friends...<03e0>I'll give it a shot.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Okay. For Reya... And, for friends...<03e0>I'll give it a shot.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Okay. For Reya... And, for friends...<03e0>I'll give it a shot.
Rush, I have need of a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Have we the time to obtain one?
Yeah, let's go.
You have my gratitude. Let us be off.
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Rush, might you lend me your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I promise to put it to good use.
Sure, no prob.
Are you certain? I appreciate your generosity.
I kinda need it right now.
Ahh...I see.
Rush, have we time to do some fighting at<03e0>the nearest battlefield? I still must prove to<03e0>my father that I can be a competent knight...
Alright, sure.
You have my gratitude. Let us be off.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
I see... Perhaps some other time.
Ought I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue my current studies? What do you think, Rush?
Sure! Try something new.
Alright.<03e0>I shall do my best to master this new field.
Stick to what you know.
As you say.<03e0>I shall further refine those spells I do know.
Decide that for yourself.
As you say...<03e0>If Father were to hear of my indecisiveness,<03e0>he would be much displeased...
Ought I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue my current studies? What do you think, Rush?

As you say. I shall further refine those<03e0>techniques I do know.
You should decide.
As you say...<03e0>If Father were to hear of my indecisiveness,<03e0>he would be much displeased...
Rush, may I ask you something? Do you<03e0>think I'm following the right path in my<03e0>training? Where should I have my focus?
You should go for balance.
Certainly, attempting everything leaves no<03e0>deficiency.
Combat arts, for sure!
Focus on the art of combat, ah? Certainly,<03e0>that is necessary for a future ruler...
Mystic arts, for sure.
I see.<03e0>Certainly it is important to master the mystic arts.
Spells, combat arts, or a mix of the two...<03e0>What ought to be my main focus? It is not<03e0>an easy decision.
Balance is the key.
Thank you. From now on I shall work hard to<03e0>earn the trust of the people of Royotia.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Thank you. From now on I shall work hard to<03e0>earn the trust of the people of Royotia.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Thank you. From now on I shall work hard to<03e0>earn the trust of the people of Royotia.
Rush, you know <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>, <03e0>right? Well, I was hoping maybe we could go find<03e0>some if it wasn't too much trouble...
Yeah, let's go.
Really? Thank you so much.<03e0>Let's go, alright?
Sorry...maybe later.
I see... Maybe some other time.
Um, Rush...<03e0>Your <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Do you think I could use it for a bit?
No prob!
It's really okay?<03e0>Thank you so much...
I kinda need it right now.
Oh...
Rush, do you think we might be able to<03e0>battle some monsters for a bit? I don't<03e0>want to get too rusty...
Sounds good to me.
Thank you.<03e0>Then, shall we be off?
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Ah, I see.<03e0>Well, maybe next time...
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or just continue my studies? What do you think, Rush?
Go for it!
You think so? Okay...I'll do my best.
Focus on what you've got!
Ahh...that makes sense. I'll try to refine<03e0>the spells I know to be more powerful.
Decide that for yourself.
Ah... You're right. If I can't even decide<03e0>this for myself, how can I help Kate...
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or just continue my studies? What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
You think so? Okay...I'll do my best.
Work on what you know.
Ahh...that makes sense. I'll try to refine<03e0>the techniques I know to be more powerful.
You should decide.
Ah... You're right. If I can't even decide<03e0>this for myself, how can I help Kate...
Rush, do you have a moment? I can't<03e0>decide how I should focus my training...
All-rounder, natch.
Makes sense...<03e0>I wouldn't have to choose either way, would I?
Combat arts, for sure!
Combat, huh? I'd better start working out...
Mystic arts, for sure.
Oh? I guess I'm not that bad at them.
Rush, how should I focus my training<03e0>from now on? Kate won't help me at all...
Balance is the key.
I understand.<03e0>I can't live under the wings of others forever, right?<03e0>I'll do my best to live up to Kate's expectations...
Combat arts is the way to go.

Ah, Rush, do you have a moment?<03e0>I am looking for <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>s...<03e0>Would you come with me to find one?
Yeah, let's go.
You've my gratitude.
Sorry...maybe later.
It's alright. Sorry for troubling you.
Rush, may I borrow your <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I'd like to put it to use...
Sure, no prob.
Are you certain? I thank you.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
Rush, do we have time to do some fighting?<03e0>I don't want to get rusty.
Sure, no prob.
Thank you.<03e0>Then, shall we be off?
Sorry... Maybe next time.
It's alright. Sorry for troubling you.
Start studying <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or stick to areas I know? Hmm...
Try something new!
As you say. It should be helpful knowledge.
Focus on what you've got!
Understood. I'll focus on making my mystic arts<03e0>as strong as possible.
You should decide.
Forgive me. It's just as you say.
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue to practice what I already know?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Alright.<03e0>I shall do my best to master this new field.
Just polish what you've got.
Alright.<03e0>I'll further refine those techniques I do know.
You should decide.
Forgive me. It's just as you say.
Rush, how should I further my training?<03e0>I'd appreciate your advice...
You should go for balance.
I see... Then I shall attempt it.
Combat arts, for sure!
Combat, ah? I see.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells, ah? I see.
What do you think I should focus on from<03e0>now on?<03e0>I value your opinion.
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Alright.<03e0>I was alone for a long, long time... But now I'll do<03e0>my best to work with everyone and succeed.
Combat arts is the way to go.

Rush, would you do something for me?<03e0>I really need a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Would you come with me to find one?
Sure, let's go.
Excellent. Then, let's not waste any time.
Sorry...maybe later.
Well! I never.
I was just thinking that your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>looked so striking... Might I borrow it for a bit?
Sure, no prob.
I appreciate it.
Ehh... I need it right now.
Well! I never.
Rush, if you have some free time, why don't we<03e0>engage in a battle or two? I admit, I'm not fond<03e0>of being inactive for too long.
Sounds like a plan.
Excellent. Then, let's not waste any time.
Sorry... Maybe next time.
To refuse a lady...!
Hmm... Shall I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue with my current studies?<03e0>Which is the wiser choice?
Try something new!
If you say so. I'll do my best to make it<03e0>worthwhile.
Stick with what you know.
If that's what you truly think, then I'll<03e0>concentrate on what I do know for now.
You should decide.
Truly, it's as you say...<03e0>I will have to give this some more thought.

You should choose, not me.
Truly, it's as you say...<03e0>I will have to give this some more thought.
Rush, what do you think I should focus on to<03e0>better myself? Recently I've been worried<03e0>about my progress...
Do it all!
Not having a particular weakness<03e0>does sound like a good choice.
Combat arts, for sure!
Ahh...<03e0>Then I shall work hard to perfect my combat arts.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Ahh...<03e0>Then I shall work hard to perfect my mystic arts.
Rush, how should I further my training?<03e0>Once again, I'd appreciate your advice...
Do it all<07f0>flexibility is good!
Understood.<03e0>I won't stray from my path again.
Combat arts is the way to go.

Rush, I really need a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Think we could go find one?
Yeah, let's go.
I owe you one.
Sorry...maybe later.
Riiight. Whatever.
Tell me about your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>More specifically, tell me you're gonna hand it over.
No prob!
You serious?<03e0>No tradebacks, got it?
Ehh... I kinda need it.
Rrgh... Don't think I'm gonna forget this.
Hey, hey, time's a wasting!<03e0>Monsters to fight, loot to collect, eh?<03e0>Let's get going!
Sounds good!
That's more like it, kid!
Sorry... Maybe next time.
Seriously?
ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Think that stuff's worth looking into?
Sure! Try something new.
Okay.<03e0>Dunno if it'll be worth anything, but I'll give<03e0>it a shot.
Stick with what you know.
Huh, so polish up what I already got...<03e0>Nothing to lose there.
You should decide.
I decided I wanted to ask you...

You should decide.
I decided I wanted to ask you...
What sorts of things should I be focusing my<03e0>training on? I've been kinda uncertain lately...
Do it all!
That didn't take long.
Combat arts, for sure!
Fighting, huh? Can't say I don't like it.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Spells, huh? Eh, wouldn't quite say I hated 'em...
Hey, Rush. What sort of training should I<03e0>focus on?<03e0>Wanted to get an outside opinion.
Balance is the key.
Alright, I'll trust you on this one.<03e0>Even if it's a bust, at least it's free.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Alright, I'll trust you on this one.<03e0>Even if it's a bust, at least it's free.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Alright, I'll trust you on this one.<03e0>Even if it's a bust, at least it's free.
Oh, so like, <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I totally need some? So, like, let's go on a harvesting<03e0>journey!
Like, totally for sure!
Sweet! This is totally not uncool of you.
Like, no.
That sucks!
So, like, your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>You should totally give it to me.
Okay...
Wow. You're so attentive to my needs.<03e0>Do you like me or something?
Ha ha ha. No.
Ugh. Cheapass.
Who likes loot? I do!<03e0>So, let's go to the battlefield and get some!
Sounds like a plan.
Like, thanks!
Sorry...maybe later.
Refused? Fail.
ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>I bet you don't even know this type of mystic arts?<03e0>but, like, I'm thinking I should learn it.
Yeah! You go, girl.
Like, here's a tip?<03e0>Never say that again.
Work on your current spells.
Really? ...Okay, fine.<03e0>I'll just totally max out my spell power then.
If that's what you want.
Wow. Being passive-aggressive?<03e0>Sooo last year.
So, I was wondering if I should learn<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>I mean, there's other stuff I could be doing...
Go for it!
Okay...<03e0>Hopefully this won't be a complete waste of time.
Stick with what you know.
Really? ...Okay, fine.<03e0>I'll just totally max out my spell power then.
Only you can decide that.
You sound just like an old woman!<03e0>I'd say it was adorable, except that it's not.
Geez, did you know it like takes a lot of work to<03e0>become a witch, or whatever?<03e0>What should I train in the meantime?
Do it all!
An awesome witch like me had better know<03e0>some of everything, right?
Combat arts, for sure!
Like, seriously? You do know that witch<03e0>equals mystic stuff, right?
Mystic arts, for sure.
Amirite? Like, cutie witch Khrynia is def<03e0>down with the mystic arts.
Okay, Rush<07f0>what do you think I should focus<03e0>my training on? I know, it's hard to believe,<03e0>but I want your opinion.
Balance is the key.
Okay. This's like the first step for those of us<03e0>who're gonna control the world.
Combat arts is the way to go.
Okay. This's like the first step for those of us<03e0>who're gonna control the world.
Mystic arts is the way to go.

Hey. If you've got time to be standing around, why don't<03e0>we go get me some <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?
Alrighty!
Appreciate it.<03e0>C'mon, let's go.
Sorry...maybe later.
Thanks for nothing, punk.
So, you gonna let me borrow your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>or what?
Okay.
Seriously? You aren't half bad.
What.
Ha ha, what a comedian. Asshat.
Hey, how 'bout we go fight some monsters, eh?<03e0>Unlike Rhagoh, I actually like kicking ass.
Sounds good to me.
Awright!<03e0>Let's hit it!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Tsk... Whatever.
You think it's worth it to try learning<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>What would you do?
Try something new!
Alright, I'll give it a shot.<03e0>Spells aren't my strong suit though.
Stick with what you know!
Makes sense. I'll try and polish up what<03e0>I do know to learn more powerful spells.
Decide that for yourself.
You're right. Geez, I sound like Rhagoh.
You think it's worth it to try learning<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>What would you do?
Go for it!
Alright.<03e0>Just know it's not my thing.
Stick with what you know.
Makes sense. I'll try and polish up what<03e0>I do know to learn more powerful skills.
Decide that for yourself.
You're right. Geez, I sound like Rhagoh.
Rush. So, if you were me, what sort of training would<03e0>you focus on? I hate to admit it, but I can't decide.
All-rounder, natch.
Makes sense...<03e0>Don't have to choose just one, eh?
Combat arts, for sure!
Figured you'd say that.<03e0>It is my specialty, after all.
Definitely mystic arts!
Eh? That's more Rhagoh's bag, but eh,<03e0>I'll give it a shot.
What sort of training do you think I should focus on?
Go for balance.
Alright, sounds good. Should be able to make<03e0>up for Rhagoh's slacking, at least.
You're a natural-born fighter.
Alright, sounds good.<03e0>Should be able to make up for Rhagoh's slacking,<03e0>at least.
Mystic arts is the way to go.
Alright, sounds good.<03e0>Should be able to make up for Rhagoh's slacking,<03e0>at least.
Rush, do you know <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I think I really need one! Do you think we'd have<03e0>time to pick one up?
Yeah, let's go.
Thank you!<03e0>Okey-dokey, let's go!
Sorry...maybe later.
Awww, really?
Say, Rush, can I see your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Like, for keeps? Or at least for borrows?
Sure, no prob.
Yay! Thank you!
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Oh...
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?<03e0>How about we go fight some monsters<03e0>or something?
Sounds like a plan.
Great! So, come on!
Sorry... Maybe next time.
Awww, really?
Should I start practicing <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or stick with what I've already been learning?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Okay! I'll do my best!
Stick with what you know.
Okey-dokey! I'll keep training so I can learn<03e0>some super-powerful spells, okay?
You should decide.
Lady Marsha tells me that all the time...

Hmm....what I should focus on for my training?<03e0>I thought maybe being the Cosmos Maiden would <03e0>help me decide, but no dice...
All-rounder, natch.
Thank you!<03e0>I'm not gonna worry<07f0>just work hard!
Combat arts, for sure!
F-fighting, huh?<03e0>Sounds hard... But I'll do my best!
Definitely mystic arts!
Mmm...<03e0>The Cosmos Maiden can't not do mystic arts, right?
I'm a little worried about my training, and I<03e0>don't know who else to ask...
Balance is the key.
Okay!<03e0>As the Cosmos Maiden, I'm going to give it my all!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Okay!<03e0>As the Cosmos Maiden, I'm going to give it my all!

Heya boyo. Reckon we might have the time<03e0>to look for some <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?
Sure, let's go.
You're a big help.<03e0>Let's be off, then.
Sorry, maybe later.
I see...<03e0>Maybe next time, then.
So, you might have noticed me eyeing your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Would you mind lendin' it to me for a bit?
Sure, no prob.
Thank ye kindly.<03e0>Don't see many kind souls like you anymore!
Ehh... I need it right now.
...
Rush, if you've got a moment, let's fight a bit outside<03e0>of town, shall we? Trainin's the most important part<03e0>of being a mercenary, ya know!
Sounds like a plan.
That's what I like to hear.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Hrn...
So I was thinking of learning<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Think that's a good idea?
Yeah, go for it!
Alright, then. The more you know, eh?
Work on your current spells.
Alright, then. I'm sure the mystic arts I know<03e0>could do with a polish, eh?
You should decide.
Ahh... Yea, my sis would be disappointed to<03e0>hear me giving this sort o' wishy-washy talk.
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue to practice what I already know?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Alright, then. The more you know, eh?
Just polish what you've got.
Alright, then. I'm sure the arts I know could<03e0>do with a polish, eh?
Decide that for yourself.
Ahh... Yea, my sis would be disappointed to<03e0>hear me giving this sort o' wishy-washy talk.
What sorts of things should I be focusing my<03e0>training on? I've been kinda uncertain lately...
All-rounder, natch.
Fair enough. Then, time to get started!
Combat arts, for sure!
Fair enough. Then, time to get started!
Definitely mystic arts!
Fair enough. Then, time to get started!
Rush, how do you think I should focus my training?<03e0>I'd appreciate your advice...
Balance is the key.
Right. Can't believe I've been wastin' all this<03e0>time... Alright, I'm gonna redouble my training,<03e0>for my sister's sake.
Combat arts is the way to go.

Hey, greenhorn. You ever heard of<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I bet you would if you came with me to find some.
Okay, sure.
Then come on.
Sorry...maybe later.
Seriously? You're turning me down?
Tell me about your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>More specifically, tell me you're gonna hand it over.
Sure, no prob.
Then, I'll be taking that!
I kinda need it right now.
*snort*
Hey, greenhorn.<03e0>How 'bout we hit the battlefields?<03e0>You could use the training, eh?
Yeah, yeah. Let's go!
Follow me!
Whatever dude, later, maybe.
Whaaat?<03e0>I don't give invitations to just anybody.
Start studying <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or stick to areas I know? Hmm...
Try something new!
I doubt anyone needs to get any more powerful<03e0>than I already am, but sure, I'll give it a shot.
Focus on what you've got!
The thought of me having even more powerful spells at<03e0>my disposal is pretty ominous, innit? But yeah,<03e0>I'll keep at it.
You should decide.
I can't believe I'm getting this from you.

I can't believe I'm getting this from you.
Okay, pop quiz, hotshot.<03e0>You're an incredible mercenary.<03e0>What do you focus on?
Do it all!
Makes sense, don't it?<03e0>I mean, I can already do everything, after all.
Combat arts, for sure!
I know, right?<03e0>Of course, I've already mastered pretty much<03e0>all there is to know about combat.
Definitely mystic arts!
I know, right?<03e0>Of course, I've already mastered pretty much<03e0>all there is to know about spellcasting.
Alright, kid, what do you think?<03e0>Should I focus my training on something new?<03e0>Or am I already too godlike already?
Balance is the key.
Awright. It'll take some training, but that's<03e0>what you gotta do if you wanna be known<03e0>as the king!
Combat arts is the way to go.

Do you have a moment?<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>, have you heard of it?<03e0>I think I need one. Shall we search?
Yeah, let's go.
Good, good.<03e0>Then let's get cracking.
Sorry...maybe later.
A pity, that...
Your <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Would you mind lending it to me for a while?
Sure, no prob.
Ahh... What a gracious child.
Ehh... I need it right now.
Tsk...
Rush, dear boy, shall we fight a bit?<03e0>Once you get to be my age, if you keep still<03e0>for too long, you can't get moving again...
Sounds like a plan.
Excellent. Let's be off, then.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Harumph...<03e0>What happened to respecting one's elders?
Hmm... <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>sounds interesting enough, hmm? But learning new arts<03e0>is a challenge when you're my age...
Try something new!
Ho ho ho...<03e0>Alright. Let's see what these old bones can do.
Focus on what you've got!
Understood. I'll focus on getting the most out<03e0>of what I already know.
Decide that for yourself.
Ha ha ha...<03e0>From the mouths of babes...
Hmm... <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>sounds interesting enough, hmm? But learning new arts<03e0>is a challenge when you're my age...
You can do it!
Really!<03e0>Then, let's see if this old dog can learn<03e0>a new trick.
Stick with what you know.
Understood.<03e0>I'll focus on polishing my combat arts.
Decide that for yourself.
Ha ha ha...<03e0>From the mouths of babes...
What sorts of focus should I have to my training?<03e0>I don't want to hold you kids back...
All-rounder, natch.
I may be a decrepit old fighter, but I'll do<03e0>my best.
Combat arts, for sure!
With the proper techniques, even the weakest<03e0>of men can hold their own in a fight.
Definitely mystic arts!
Mystic arts can help friends out of tight spots,<03e0>hmm.
Rush, dear boy, old as I am I feel strange to ask<03e0>you, but what sort of training do you think I should<03e0>pursue from now on?
Go for balance.
Excellent.<03e0>Just watch, son<07f0>this old man's in it 'til<03e0>the end!
Combat arts is the way to go.

Sure, no prob.
Let's get going, then.
Sorry...maybe later.
Ah, I see.
Hey, would you let me borrow your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>for a while?
Sure, no prob.
Seriously? Thanks.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
...
Rush, think we could hit the battlefields<03e0>for a bit? I want to work on some spells.
Sounds like a plan.
Appreciate it. Come on!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
...
Wonder if I should look into <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...
Try something new!
Alright. I'm always up for a challenge!
Focus on what you've got!
Yes... I'll continue my training so that I can<03e0>learn even more powerful spells.
You should decide.
Seems that way...<03e0>Let me think on it some more.
Wonder if I should look into <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...
Try something new!
Alright. I'm always up for a challenge!
Focus on what you've got!
Yes... I'll continue my training so that I can<03e0>learn even more powerful spells.
You should decide.
Seems that way...<03e0>Let me think on it some more.
I wonder what I should focus on for my training...<03e0>I wanna be helpful and all, you know?
Try a little of everything.
I guess... Best of both worlds, huh?
Combat arts, for sure!
C-combat arts, huh...<03e0>I totally blew at that before, but I guess I can<03e0>give it a try...
Definitely mystic arts!
Yeah, that makes sense... I've trained all this<03e0>time to be a spellcrafter, after all.
Hey, Rush<07f0>do you think I'm doing okay,<03e0>helping everyone out? If you think there's<03e0>a way I can be more useful...
Balance is the key.
Right...<03e0>And if I work hard, I know I can make it happen.
Combat arts is the way to go.

Hey! You know what would be super-special awesome?<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>!<03e0>Let's find some!
Yeah, let's go.
Awesome-possum! So let's saddle up!
Sorry, dude.
Guess somebody's got their ticket for the failboat.
Your <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>!<03e0>You must give me it!
O-kay...
Really? Really!? Sweeto!
Uhh...no.
Ooh, aren't we Mr. Grabby-hands, keeping all<03e0>the loot for himself... Well, poo on your shoe<03e0>and crap in your lap!
Heya, Rush!<03e0>Don'tcha think it's time for a little of that<03e0>ultra-violence? Let's go fight monsters!
Sounds like a plan.
Awright! It's clobberin' time!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Whaaat?  You're busy? Too busy for me!?<03e0>...Why is everyone always too busy for me...
Hey Rush... Should I learn this new type of arts,<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>I mean, what if I'm bad at it<07f0>er, I mean, it sucks?
Try something new!
Yeah? I guess I am a natural.<03e0>Great idea!
Focus on what you've got!
Yeah? Okay! I'll work on what I've got until<03e0>I'm the mystic arts master!
You should decide.
Urg... I'm not good at being the decider...
So it'd be pretty awesome to learn<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>, huh...<03e0>But maybe I should stick with what I've got for now...
Try something new!
I know, right?<03e0>More arts equals more awesome!
Just polish what you've got.
I know, right? I'll polish what I know until<03e0>they're the shining star I am! ...Or whatever.
Decide that for yourself.
Geh... I asked you because I don't like<03e0>making decisions...
Hey, Rush, what should I train from now on<03e0>to become more awesomer? I can't think of<03e0>how to become any more incredible myself...
Go for balance.
Oh yeah? That sounds good.
Combat arts, for sure!
Oh yeah? That sounds good.
Definitely mystic arts!
Oh yeah? That sounds good.
Rush, Rush! You gotta help me<07f0>this is very important!<03e0>What should I train in? I can't commit, so you decide.
All 'rounder is the way to go.
You know, wishy-washy schmooping around is my<03e0>tragic flaw. But since you just made the decision, all I<03e0>have to do is blame you when it goes wrong! Thanks!

Hey, kid, you know<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>, right?<03e0>Why don't we go out and find some?
Yeah, let's go.
Appreciate it, kid. Let's head out.
Sorry...maybe later.
Whaaat!?
Your <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Mind lending it to me for a while?
Sure, no prob.
Appreciate it, kid.
Ehh...kinda need it right now.
Are you serious!?
Say, Rush. I'm getting antsy...<03e0>What say we pick up some battles, hmm?
Sounds good to me!
Great! Let's get hopping!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
Whaaat!?
Start studying <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or stick to areas I know? Hmm...
Try something new!
Yes, yes, sounds like that should be good<03e0>and powerful.
Focus on what you've got!
Huh, alright.<03e0>I'll beef up my skills so I can learn more<03e0>powerful spells!
You should decide.
Gah, you sound like Pagus...

Gah, you sound like Maddox...
Hey, kid. What do you think I should be<03e0>focusing my training on? I've been thinking<03e0>day and night and I still can't decide.
Try a little of everything.
Hey, that sounds good! Alright, done.<03e0>That's what I'm doing.
Combat arts, for sure!
Hey, that sounds good! Alright, done.<03e0>That's what I'm doing.
Definitely mystic arts!
You said it! Yup, that's what I'm gonna do!
Ohh, hey, kid. So, I've been thinking about<03e0>my training again... Yeah, even a guy like me's<03e0>gotta think about the future.
Balance is the key.
Huh...huh, alright. Can't be letting Pagus and<03e0>Maddox be the only ones looking like heroes!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Huh...huh, alright. Can't be letting Pagus and<03e0>Maddox be the only ones looking like heroes!

Rush, I'd really like a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Do you think we'd have time to pick one up?
Yeah, let's go.
Thanks!
Sorry...maybe later.
Oh, you must be pretty busy!
Say, Rush, can I maybe borrow your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?
Sure, no prob.
For real? Thanks a million!
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Aww...
Hi-hi, Rush! I really wanna do some training...<03e0>Can we go fight monsters, huh, can we can we?
Okay, sure.
Thanks! I promise to get even stronger!
Sorry...maybe later.
Ahh, okay... I guess you're pretty busy, huh...
Hi, Rush. So I was wondering if I should learn<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...
Try something new!
You think? Okay, I'll give it a go...<03e0>Hopefully it'll make me stronger!
Focus on what you've got!
Huhhh, so I should study harder so I can learn<03e0>more powerful spells? Got it!
You should decide.
Uh<07f0>y-yeah, I guess. Sorry...

Combat, huh... I'll give it a try!
Definitely mystic arts!
Spells, huh.........<03e0>...Uhh, I'll give it a try!
I wonder what I should focus on for my training...<03e0>I wanna be helpful and all, you know?

Rush, I really need a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Do we have time to find one?
Yeah, let's go.
Ho ho ho. You have my gratitude.
Sorry...maybe later.
A pity.
Say, Rush, would you could lend me your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>for a bit?
Sure, no prob.
Ho ho ho. You have my gratitude.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Coldblooded...
Rush, do we have time to do some fighting<03e0>at the nearest battlefield? My usual training<03e0>doesn't feel like it was enough today...
Sounds like a plan.
Ho ho ho!<03e0>This should be fun!
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
...
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue to refine what I already know?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
Ho ho ho... Alright.<03e0>Let's see what these old bones can do.
Focus on what you've got!
Hum, hum, I see, I see!<03e0>Then, I'll continue to train so that I can learn<03e0>more powerful spells.
You should decide.
You sound like Pagus... *sigh*

You sound like Sibal... *sigh*
Rush, do you think my training is going in<03e0>the correct direction?<03e0>I've been a little worried of late.
Try a little of everything.
Ho ho ho, there wouldn't be anything to worry<03e0>about in that case, ah.
Focus on combat arts!
Alright!<03e0>Believe it or not, I was an army general! I have<03e0>utmost confidence in my abilities.
Focus on mystic arts!
Alright!<03e0>Believe it or not, I was an army general! I have<03e0>utmost confidence in my abilities.
Rush, what do you think about my current<03e0>progress? I want to be as helpful as I can.
Balance is the key.
Alright, Rush. I'm decided.<03e0>This old man's still got a lot to fight for!
Combat arts is the way to go.
Alright, Rush. I'm decided.<03e0>This old man's still got a lot to fight for!

Understood.<03e0>It seems there's a lot more for me to work on!
I need a <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>,<03e0>so you should take the time to get me one.
Alright!
All according to plan.<03e0>Come.
Sorry.
...You will regret this.
That <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0> you have.<03e0>Give it to me.
Sure!
All according to plan.<03e0>Finally, it is mine...
Mmm, no, sorry.
Rrgh... I will remember this.
If you are as free as you seem, then let's<03e0>find a place to fight. I'm incredibly bored.<03e0>Humor me.
Let's go!
All according to plan.<03e0>Let us go.
Sorry... Maybe another time.
Rrgh...
Study <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>, or<03e0>to continue one's current studies? ...I realize thinking is<03e0>trying for you, but what would you do?
Anything new is worth trying!
Heh. Obviously I had already planned to do that.
Focus on what you know.
Learn more powerful forms of the mystic arts<03e0>I know? Of course I've decided to do that.
You gotta choose for yourself.
What a pathetically mitra-like answer.
Learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>,<03e0>a brand-new technique, or continue honing my current<03e0>skills? You may give your opinion this one and only time.

Heh. Obviously.
Combat arts, for sure.
Heh. Obviously.
Mystic arts, for sure.
Heh. Obviously.
What should I focus on now, to become<03e0>the perfect fighter? I certainly won't be<03e0>outdone by a loser like Torgal.
All 'rounder is the way to go.
Hmm. I suppose that to complete my training,<03e0>I can waste a little more time with you people.
Go for the fighting!
Hmm. I suppose that to complete my training,<03e0>I can waste a little more time with you people.
Become a mystic master!
Hmm. I suppose that to complete my training,<03e0>I can waste a little more time with you people.
Rush, I have need of a<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>.<03e0>Is there time to find one?
Sure, no problem.
Thank you. I am in your debt.
Sorry...maybe later.
A pity.
Would you allow me to borrow your<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?
No prob!
Thank you. You've been a big help.
Ehh... I kinda need it right now.
Forgive me. I spoke out of turn.
Rush, do we have time to engage some monsters?<03e0>It would not do to slack on training.
Sounds like a plan.
Ahh.
Ahh, kinda busy, sorry.
I see...
Should I learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>?<03e0>Or continue to refine what I already know?<03e0>What do you think, Rush?
Try something new!
As you say. It should be helpful knowledge.
Focus on what you've got!
Understood. I'll focus on polishing the spells<03e0>I know to be as strong as possible.
You should decide.
I was told that before, once...

All-rounder, natch.
An unerring judgment.<03e0>Of course, I expected nothing less.
Combat arts, for sure!
An unerring judgment.<03e0>Of course, I expected nothing less.
Definitely mystic arts!

Uhh...okay.
Then come<07f0>quickly!
Uhh...maybe later.
Impudent whelp...!
What is that...<03e01be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce0>...<03e0>Give it to me at once.
Since you asked so nicely...
What a surprisingly pleasant child.
No, I don't think so.
...Smart-mouthed whelp!
Boy! Let us go to the fields of battle and<03e0>destroy all in our path! I shall show you<03e0>the greatness of the sovani!
Okay, I'm game.
Come!
Uhh...not right now.
Pathetic mitra worm...
To learn <1be0ffbe34ff2ae00b00>ptalk_embed<00001ce003e0>or not... If you truly would claim to lead this group,<03e0>then you must give your opinion!
Go for it.
Heh... You are wiser than your years...we are<03e0>in agreement. This spell would be a great boon<03e0>to my skill set.
Stick with what you know.
Heh...we are in agreement. At this point<03e0>there is no other choice than to become<03e0>even more proficient at my current skills.

Kids today! How many shields do you really need?<03e0>You've only got one body, eh? If you want more,<03e0>you'd better sell some or give some away.
You can't hold any more accessories, boy.<03e0>Come back when you've sold or discarded<03e0>something.
Kids today, buying things like it's going out of<03e0>style! If you want any more of those, first<03e0>get rid of the ones you've already got!

I'm sorry, son... You don't have enough<03e0>money to buy that.
Good heavens, child. You're going to hurt<03e0>yourself with all those weapons. You'd<03e0>better get rid of some before getting more.
Now then, you know you don't need<03e0>that many shields. Why don't you sell<03e0>or discard some, hmm?
I'm sorry, dear, but I don't think you can<03e0>carry any more accessories. Why don't<03e0>you sell or discard some?
That's enough of those, dear, don't you<03e0>think? Why don't you sell or discard<03e0>some before buying more?
We don't get stock like this often.<03e0>Not since the winter of<07f0>well, no<03e0>need to talk your ear off.

Monsters within encounter range are <28e01700>$$<0200ffff02000000> and <28e0>"$$<0200ffff02000000>.<03e028e0>!$$<0200ffff02000000> are monsters that can be linked into the battle.
Pressing <1be040c0ffff2be0>7<f8fff8fff8ff010000002be0>8<f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0> calls up the target cursor.<03e0>Placing the target cursor over a monster will<03e0>show its name and stats.
The target cursor can give useful information not<03e0>only on monsters too far off to see their icon,<03e0>but people and things in towns and the field.
Monsters that have seen Rush may bring nearby<03e0>monsters into battle with them. This is called a <1be0ffbe34ff>link<1ce0>.

Select a <1be0ffbe34ff>formation<1ce0>.<03e0>Formations decide a unit's position and location<03e0>on the Union Board. Different formations can have<03e0>different results in battle.
Position units on <1be0ffbe34ff>the Union Board<1ce0>.<03e0>The topmost unit is named <1be0ffbe34ff>the leader<1ce0>, and must<03e0>be determined. The rest can be skipped.
The Union Board has areas for lead ranks and back ranks.<03e0>Generally, the front three rows are for the lead ranks, while<03e0>the rear two are for back ranks. The lead ranks are best at<03e0>dealing and defending against physical damage, while the<03e0>back ranks are good for mystic attacks and defense.
A formation's strength depends on the members of the<03e0>union performing it. Some characters are particularly<03e0>effective in certain formations. Try different<03e0>combinations and see what happens!
Change locations through the <1be0ffbe34ff>world map<1ce0>. By selecting<03e0>a place on the map, you can instantly travel there.
When selecting a town, you'll be taken to its <1be0ffbe34ff>City Map<1ce0>.<03e0>From there, you can select a specific area of town<03e0>to go to.

Battle Commands
Pressing <1be040c0ffff2be01e00f8fff8fff8ff010000002be01f00f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0> selects targets, while<03e0>pressing <1be040c0ffff2be01c00f8fff8fff8ff010000002be01d00f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0> selects battle commands.<03e0>Pressing <1be040c0ffff2be0>%<f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0> displays the status of the units in<03e0>the currently selected union. You can <1be0ff4060ff>check units'<03e0>actions and any status ailments<1ce0>.
Deadlock
When unions are caught in close combat, it is<03e0>known as <1be0ffbe34ff>Deadlock<1ce0>. In such situations, the two<03e0>sides must battle until only one is left.
While in <1be0ffbe34ff>Deadlock<1ce0>, <1be0ff4060ff>targeting is limited<1ce0>.<03e0>Only adjacent unions may be targeted.
When targets are changed to adjacent unions, certain<03e0>commands can break Deadlock. When breaking free<03e0>from Deadlock, the opposing union has a free chance<03e0>to attack. Don't act too rashly in these situations!
A Mystic Chance<1ce0> gives the opportunity to learn a new<03e0>Mystic Art, or level up an existing Mystic Art. You may<03e0>choose the art you would like to learn from a list.
Captured monsters may be <1be0ffbe34ff>split<1ce0> for components.<03e0>However, intact monsters may be sold in certain shops<03e0>for high prices. Choose wisely<07f0>you only get the choice<03e0>to split a monster once.
Once certain monsters have been sold to shops,<03e0>those shops may begin selling <1be0ffbe34ff>trade goods<1ce0>.
This is how units in the party can request certain loot.<03e0>Units try to collect items to strengthen their equipment.
A unit's request for an item can be removed<03e0>from the list by selecting them.
Battle Controls
Pressing <1be040c0ffff2be01e00f8fff8fff8ff010000002be01f00f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0> switches targets, while<03e0>pressing <1be040c0ffff2be01c00f8fff8fff8ff010000002be01d00f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0> selects battle commands.<03e0>Select a command with <1be040c0ffff2be0> <f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0>, or cancel with <1be040c0ffff2be0>!<f8fff8fff8ff010000001ce0>.
Battle
Each entity in a battle is called a <1be0ffbe34ff>unit<1ce0>.<03e0>These units are organized into groups, called <1be0ffbe34ff>unions<1ce0>.
In battle, you will <1be0ff4060ff>command friendly unions for<03e0>large-scale assaults<1ce0>. The specific directions you may<03e0>give are displayed as <1be0ffbe34ff>battle commands<1ce0>.
At the top right of the screen is a <1be0ffbe34ff>battle<03e0>navigation map<1ce0> showing the positions of<03e0>all unions engaged in battle.
Available battle commands change depending on<03e0>conditions such as the positions and makeup of<03e0>friendly and enemy unions. Keep these conditions in<03e0>mind to give appropriate battle orders.
Morale
The large red and blue bar across the top of the screen<03e0>is called the <1be0ffbe34ff>Morale Gauge<1ce0>. It measures you and your<03e0>enemies' will to fight.
As morale rises, attacks become stronger and more<03e0>effective. Conversely, as morale falls, defenses weaken<03e0>and unions do less damage.
Morale fluctuates <1be0ff4060ff>based on the performance of both<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>sides in battle<1ce0>. Make it a habit to keep track of your<03e0>troops' morale.
Critical Trigger
Sometimes during battle, a <1be0ffbe34ff>Trigger Chance<1ce0> will occur.<03e0>During a Trigger Chance, you'll be given a brief opportunity<03e0>to press a certain button on the controller.<03e0>A well-timed button press will launch a <1be0ffbe34ff>Critical Trigger<1ce0>,<03e0>giving your side a definite advantage in battle.
Successful Trigger Chances while on the attack will<03e0>launch a <1be0ffbe34ff>Critical Offense<1ce0>. This will cause the next<03e0>friendly unit to act faster than usual.
Successful Trigger Chances while being attacked<03e0>launch a <1be0ffbe34ff>Critical Defense<1ce0>. This can change a simple<03e0>block to a shield bash, or a dodge to a counterattack.
If you find you just can't keep up with the timing,<03e0>Critical Triggers can be switched to occur<03e0>automatically through the Config Menu.
Critical Trigger Settings<1ce0> have been added to<03e0>the Config Menu!
Guest Unions
When a <1be0ffbe34ff>guest union<1ce0> joins the party, <1be0ff4060ff>you cannot assign<03e0>it battle commands<1ce007f0>it acts on its own. See if you can<03e0>determine how to support your guest in battles!
Enemy Advantage
If you are touched by a monster in the field,<03e0>the following battle will be to the <1be0ffbe34ff>enemy's<03e0>advantage<1ce0>. This can be avoided by <1be0ff4060ff>engaging<03e0>monsters<1ce0> in battle yourself.
KO
A union's HP is the sum of each member's HP.<03e0>Instead of worrying about the HP of individual<03e0>units, watch that of the union instead. If the<03e01be0ff4060ff>union's HP falls to 0, then the whole union is<03e0>Incapacitated<1ce0>, and will be unable to act.
Botch
If a union's leader falls in battle, it is a <1be0ffbe34ff>Botch<1ce0>.<03e0>Afterwards, that union can no longer accept battle<03e0>commands, meaning the remaining members<03e0>cannot be commanded.
Flank Attack
When in Deadlock, if a union is attacked from the<03e0>side, it is known as a <1be0ffbe34ff>Flank Attack<1ce0>. It is possible<03e0>to be flanked by two unions at a time.<03e01be0ff4060ff>Unions performing Flank Attacks deal extra damage<1ce0>.
Rear Assault
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by<03e0>two unions, any further unions Deadlocking the<03e0>victim union launch a <1be0ffbe34ff>Rear Assault<1ce0>.<03e01be0ff4060ff>Unions performing Rear Assaults deal extra damage<1ce0>.
Massive Strike
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by<03e0>two unions and Rear Assaulted by a third, any<03e0>further unions Deadlocking the victim union<03e0>launch a <1be0ffbe34ff>Massive Strike<1ce0>. <1be0ff4060ff>Unions participating<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>in a Massive Strike deal extra damage<1ce0>.
Deadlock Interference
If an enemy union is attempting to Deadlock a<03e0>friendly union but instead is caught in Deadlock<03e0>itself, this is called <1be0ffbe34ff>Interference<1ce0>.<03e0>When it's the player's side that gets caught,<03e0>it is called <1be0ffbe34ff>Interception<1ce0>.
Raidlock
It is possible to force a union into Deadlock without<03e0>being physically nearby. This is called a <1be0ffbe34ff>Raidlock<1ce0>.<03e01be0ff4060ff>Damage dealt increases during a Raidlock.
Directing units to use mystic attacks will make<03e0>them <1be0ff4060ff>channel energy through their weapons to<03e0>perform mystic arts<1ce0>. Mystic arts encompass<03e0>everything from long-range attacks to recovery<03e0>spells. However, they can take a long time to cast.
When you direct units to do physical attacks, they'll<03e01be0ff4060ff>attack with their equipped weapon, or perform<03e0>combat arts<1ce0>. You can learn different combat arts<03e0>depending on your wield style, so try different<03e0>combinations and see what happens.
By selecting <1be0ffbe34ff>Quests<1ce0> on the Party Menu,<03e0>you can check your current progress.

LOCATION TIPS DUMMY
Action Point<1ce0> Strategies<03e0>Every time a unit performs arts in battle, AP is consumed.<03e0>However, <1be0ff4060ff>AP is recovered each turn<1ce0>, so don't feel like<03e0>you have to go out of your way to conserve it.<03e0>Item arts consume materials, and thus do not consume AP.
Each character in battle is called a <1be0ffbe34ff>unit<1ce0>, and can be<03e0>grouped into <1be0ffbe34ff>unions<1ce0> through the Union Board on the<03e0>main menu. <1be0ff4060ff>Unions share aggregate HP and AP, and<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>act as a single entity in battle<1ce0>. A union's makeup can<03e0>have a dramatic impact on battles. Try different combos!
Units can be grouped into unions through the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Union Board<1ce0> on the main menu. By arranging unions,<03e0>you can <1be0ff4060ff>cover the units' specific weaknesses and take<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>advantage of their strengths<1ce0>. There are countless<03e0>combinations of units<07f0>try to find the most effective ones.
The myriad skills a unit learns are known as <1be0ffbe34ff>arts<1ce0>.<03e0>Arts become more powerful as they are used.<03e0>Frequently using arts in the same category<03e0>enables the user to learn stronger arts of that category.
Rush is able to learn many types of arts.<03e0>By focusing on <1be0ffbe34ff>armed combat<1ce0>, he learns <1be0ffbe34ff>combat arts<1ce0>.<03e0>By finding <1be0ffbe34ff>gems<1ce0> that allow one to focus mystic<03e0>energy, he may learn <1be0ffbe34ff>mystic arts<1ce0>. By finding<03e01be0ffbe34ff>recipes<1ce0> for crafting, he can learn <1be0ffbe34ff>item arts<1ce0>.
Special physical attacks performed with weapons are<03e0>called <1be0ffbe34ff>combat arts<1ce0>. Combat arts differ based on the<03e0>equipped weapon and wield style. Make certain to do<03e0>plenty of experimentation if you wish to get them all.
Channeling arcane energy through weapons is known<03e0>as <1be0ffbe34ff>mystic arts<1ce0>. Mystic arts encompass a wide range<03e0>of skills, from long-range attacks to recovery spells.<03e0>However, they take time to cast, requiring some degree<03e0>of planning.
*<1be0ffbe34ff>Invocations<1ce0> are close-range mystic attack spells.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Evocations<1ce0> are long-range mystic attack spells.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Hexes<1ce0> are status-affecting support spells.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Remedies<1ce0> are spells that recover status or HP.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Psionics<1ce0> allow casters to control the actions of foes.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Wards<1ce0> allow casters to support allies.
Item arts<1ce0> are skills using consumables to create<03e0>useful things such as potions or herbs. Item arts<03e0>consume items instead of AP, and are relatively<03e0>quick to cast. Consumables can be found in specialty<03e0>shops, or by harvesting in the field.
*<1be0ffbe34ff>Herbs<1ce0> combine plants for recovery.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Potions<1ce0> combine liquids for useful supplements.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Lotions<1ce0> combine medicines to make healing balms.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Explosives<1ce0> combine explosive powders.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Shards<1ce0> can be fused and used for attacks.<03e0>*<1be0ffbe34ff>Traps<1ce0> are made from special parts to trip up the foe.
The <1be0ffbe34ff>one-handed<1ce0> wield style is speedy and allows for<03e0>users to equip a shield. However, its attack power is low.<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Power grip<1ce0> wield style has increased<03e0>strength, but attacks take longer.<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Dual wield<1ce0> style is unmatched in attack<03e0>power, but makes it nigh impossible to avoid attacks.
Sovani can <1be0ffbe34ff>quad wield<1ce0>, using four weapons at once<03e0>for crushing attack strength. Their <1be0ffbe34ff>dual power grip<1ce003e0>delivers even more powerful blows. However, both<03e0>types of attacks take longer to pull off.
Certain battle commands can allow a unit to change<03e0>wield styles during battle. This is limited by the type<03e0>of weapon the unit currently has equipped. For<03e0>example, if a unit equips a two-handed weapon,<03e0>it cannot change its wield style from two-handed.
Equipment comes in four sizes: small, midsize, large,<03e0>and huge. In general, the sizes are split by race:<03e0>qsiti small and midsize, mitra midsize and large,<03e0>and yama large and huge. Sovani are limited to<03e0>special sovani weapons, and do not use shields.
When units are placed on the Union Board, they may<03e0>be arranged in special patterns called <1be0ffbe34ff>formations<1ce0>.<03e01be0ff4060ff>Formations grant unions certain effects in battle<1ce0>.<03e0>They are learnt and improved through special items<03e0>found across the world, so keep an eye out.
When units are placed in a formation, <1be0ff4060ff>units in the<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>lead ranks have increased physical attack and defense<1ce0>,<03e0>while <1be0ff4060ff>units in the back ranks have increased<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>mystic attack and defense<1ce0>. Keep this in<03e0>mind when arranging your units.
Some formations can level up when certain<03e0>conditions are met. While formations already grant<03e0>certain bonuses to different stats, these <1be0ffbe34ff>variant<1ce003e01be0ffbe34ff>formations<1ce0> will grant even greater bonuses.
When unions are caught in close combat, it is<03e0>known as <1be0ffbe34ff>Deadlock<1ce0>. In such situations, the two<03e0>unions are set in what they may target. If a Deadlocked<03e0>union is commanded to perform long-range attacks,<03e0>support skills, or movements, Deadlock is broken.
Canceling Deadlock leaves a union wide open to<03e0>attack and gives the opposite union a large<03e0>damage bonus. Keep this in mind.
If a Deadlocked union is melee attacked from the<03e0>side, it is known as a <1be0ffbe34ff>Flank Attack<1ce0>. It is possible<03e0>to be flanked by two unions at a time.<03e01be0ff4060ff>Unions performing Flank Attacks deal extra damage.
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by<03e0>two unions, any further union Deadlocking the<03e0>victim union launches a <1be0ffbe34ff>Rear Assault<1ce0>.<03e01be0ff4060ff>Unions performing Rear Assaults deal extra damage.
When in Deadlock, if one union is Flank Attacked by<03e0>two unions and Rear Assaulted by a third, any<03e0>further unions Deadlocking the victim union<03e0>launch a <1be0ffbe34ff>Massive Strike<1ce0>. <1be0ff4060ff>Unions participating<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>in a Massive Strike deal extra damage<1ce0>.
Some special unions, such as those containing certain<03e0>extremely large units, are able to Deadlock multiple unions<03e0>at once. This is called a <1be0ffbe34ff>Multi Deadlock<1ce0>.
A union victim to a Flank Attack, Rear Assault, or<03e0>Massive Strike will be hit for additional damage.<03e0>The damage bonus for Rear Assault and Massive<03e0>Strike is greater than that for Flank Attack.
It is possible to force a union into Deadlock without<03e0>being physically near. This is called a <1be0ffbe34ff>Raidlock<1ce0>.<03e0>While raiding, the target union is hit for extra damage,<03e0>but the raid only lasts for one turn.
Weapons come in three main categories, dealing certain types of damage:<03e0>* Swords and katana, or <1be0ffbe34ff>blades<1ce0>, mainly deal <1be0ffbe34ff>slashing damage<1ce0>.<03e0>* Axes and maces, or <1be0ffbe34ff>breakers<1ce0>, mainly deal <1be0ffbe34ff>mauling damage<1ce0>.<03e0>* Spears and staves, or <1be0ffbe34ff>polearms<1ce0>, mainly deal <1be0ffbe34ff>bludgeoning<1ce0> or <1be0ffbe34ff>piercing damage<1ce0>.<03e0>Be mindful of the types of weapons units equip when forming unions.
Weapons also have <1be0ffbe34ff>attack strength<1ce0>, <1be0ffbe34ff>parry rate<1ce0>,<03e01be0ffbe34ff>weight<1ce0>, and <1be0ffbe34ff>damage absorption<1ce0> stats.<03e0>* Attack strength affects the amount of damage dealt.<03e0>* Parry rate affects the likelihood of Critical Triggers.<03e0>* Weight affects the action order.<03e0>* Damage absorption alleviates the HP lost by attacks.<03e0>While not all of these stats display in menus, be mindful<03e0>of units' weapons when forming unions.
Weapons and combat arts all deal <1be0ffbe34ff>slashing<1ce0>, <1be0ffbe34ff>bludgeoning<1ce0>,<03e01be0ffbe34ff>mauling<1ce0>, or <1be0ffbe34ff>piercing damage<1ce0>.<03e0>These attributes can add to the damage dealt to a target.
If a union's leader falls in battle, it is a <1be0ffbe34ff>Botch<1ce0>.<03e0>Afterwards, <1be0ff4060ff>that union can no longer accept battle<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>commands<1ce0>, meaning the remaining members<03e0>cannot be commanded.
If a unit has a single one-handed weapon equipped,<03e0>it may also equip a shield. Shields are beneficial<03e0>for <1be0ff4060ff>evading attacks<1ce0>.
When a unit continues to engage and defeat enemies,<03e0>a <1be0ffbe34ff>battle chain<1ce0> is formed. As chains become higher,<03e0>player units grow at a faster rate. Getting ambushed<03e0>or returning to the World Map will break the chain.
A count is kept of the <1be0ffbe34ff>number of enemy units<1ce003e01be0ffbe34ff>defeated per battle<1ce0>. As this count rises, the amount<03e0>and quality of loot dropped by the monsters rises as well.
* <1be0ffbe34ff>Necklaces<1ce0> tend to raise mystic defense.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Rings<1ce0> tend to raise intellect.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Bracelets<1ce0> tend to raise HP.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Earrings<1ce0> tend to raise physical defense.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Belts<1ce0> tend to raise strength.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Anklets<1ce0> tend to raise speed.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Amulets<1ce0> tend to raise AP.
Gems<1ce0> are special types of accessories<03e0>granting benefits like no other.
Sometimes after defeating a monster, you may capture<03e0>it, and the option is given to split it into component<03e0>items. Alternately, monsters may be sold intact to<03e0>shops for a high price. Choose to split or not depending<03e0>on your need.
Selling captured monsters to shops increases your<03e01be0ffbe34ff>commerce points<1ce0>. Once your commerce points<03e0>have reached a certain level, shops will begin offering<03e01be0ffbe34ff>trade goods<1ce0>.
Certain items gained by harvesting or defeating<03e0>monsters are known as <1be0ffbe34ff>components<1ce0>. Components<03e0>can be used at customization shops to enhance<03e0>or create new equipment. Some components may<03e0>also be purchased.
Components can be gained by splitting captured<03e0>monsters for parts. In fact, some components can<03e0>only be obtained in this manner. Moving the cursor<03e0>over captured monsters on the battle results screen<03e0>will show what items would be gained upon splitting them.
Some components can be gained by disassembling<03e0>weapons at customization shops. In fact, some<03e0>components can only be obtained in this manner.<03e0>Moving the cursor over the equipment while in the<03e0>customization shop menu will show what items<03e0>would be gained upon disassembling it.
Some monsters will not drop components until<03e0>you have acquired certain rare items.
Each unit has its own <1be0ffbe34ff>stats<1ce007f0>Strength, Intellect, and Speed.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Strength<1ce0> affects physical attack and defense.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Intellect<1ce0> affects mystic attack and defense.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Speed<1ce0> affects action order and evasion.<03e0>Each unit's stats affect the performance of the<03e0>whole union, so keep them in mind.
Units improve their stats by participating in battles.<03e0>Harsher monsters give players bigger boosts.
Each character has his own unique stat. Even if it seems<03e0>to be useless at first glance, the time may come when it<03e0>has a significant effect.
Performance in battle affects units' morale. As one<03e0>might expect, high morale increases performance,<03e0>while units with low morale are not as effective.<03e0>The morale of both the friendly and enemy forces<03e0>is displayed across the top of the screen.
If a Critical Offense is successful as part of a <1be0ffbe34ff>combo<1ce0>,<03e0>the next player unit to act is bumped up to the next<03e0>action, and will also be granted a Critical Offense.<03e0>Additionally, the attack of the final unit to act in that<03e0>union will deal a critical hit.
When a targeted unit successfully blocks an attack<03e0>with a weapon, the damage it would have received<03e0>is completely nullified. Sometimes, the Critical Defense<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Parry<1ce0> is performed, not only nullifying damage but<03e0>inflicting Blacked Out status on the attacker.
When a unit successfully blocks an attack with a<03e0>shield, the damage it would have received is<03e0>completely nullified. Sometimes, the Critical<03e0>Defense <1be0ffbe34ff>Shield Bash<1ce0> is performed, not only<03e0>nullifying damage but inflicting damage on the<03e0>attacker.
When a unit successfully dodges an attack, the<03e0>damage it would have received is completely<03e0>nullified. Sometimes, the Critical Defense<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Counterattack<1ce0> is performed, not only<03e0>nullifying damage, but inflicting damage on the<03e0>attacker.
* When a unit is <1be0ffbe34ff>Blacked Out<1ce0>, <03e0>  it cannot act or react until the turn ends.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Petrification<1ce0> means the unit is turning to stone.<03e0>  Each damaging attack has a chance to cause KO.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Shocked<1ce0> units have 0 defense against<03e0>  thunder and do not get Critical Triggers.
* <1be0ffbe34ff>Burned<1ce0> units have 0 defense against fire,<03e0>  and always act last.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Frozen<1ce0> units have 0 defense against ice,<03e0>  and do not get extra attacks.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Acid Burn<1ce0> units have 0 defense against poison,<03e0>  and their Special Defense falls to 0.
* Units blessed with <1be0ffbe34ff>Protection<1ce003e0>  are surrounded by a wall of mystic energy, fully<03e0>  blocking 1 physical attack.<03e0>* Units covered by an <1be0ffbe34ff>Orphic Ward<1ce003e0>  are surrounded by a wall of mystic energy, fully<03e0>  blocking 1 mystic attack.
* Units with the status <1be0ffbe34ff>Phys Eater<1ce003e0>  absorb as HP all physical damage received<03e0>  for a set number of turns.<03e0>* Units with the status <1be0ffbe34ff>Mystic Eater<1ce003e0>  absorb as HP all mystic damage received<03e0>  for a set number of turns.
* <1be0ffbe34ff>Paralyzed<1ce0> unions are blocked from using<03e0>  combat arts for a set number of turns.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Silenced<1ce0> unions are blocked from using<03e0>  mystic arts for a set number of turns.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Poisoned<1ce0> unions lose a percentage<03e0>  of HP after each unit's turn.
* <1be0ffbe34ff>Cursed<1ce0> unions have the chance of<03e0>  instant death before each unit's action.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Enthralled<1ce0> unions are ensorcelled to mistake<03e0>  friend for foe, and thus attack the wrong side<03e0>  until the end of battle.
* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>Decoy<1ce0> status<03e0>  attract all enemy attention<07f0>and attacks.<03e0>* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>Stealth<1ce0> status<03e0>  cannot be caught in Deadlock.
* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>Charge Up<1ce0> status<03e0>  receive an additional amount of AP each turn.<03e0>* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>Charge Down<1ce0> status<03e0>  receive a reduced amount of AP each turn.
* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>STR Up<1ce0>, <1be0ffbe34ff>INT Up<1ce0>, or<03e0>  <1be0ffbe34ff>SPD Up<1ce0> statuses receive boosts to stats.<03e0>* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>STR Down<1ce0>, <1be0ffbe34ff>INT Down<1ce0>, or<03e0>  <1be0ffbe34ff>SPD Down<1ce0> statuses receive cuts to stats.
* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>ATK Up<1ce0>, <1be0ffbe34ff>DEF Up<1ce0>, or<03e0>  <1be0ffbe34ff>Evasion Up<1ce0> statuses receive boosts to those stats.<03e0>* Unions with <1be0ffbe34ff>ATK Down<1ce0>, <1be0ffbe34ff>DEF Down<1ce0>, or<03e0>  <1be0ffbe34ff>Evasion Down<1ce0> statuses receive cuts to those stats.
By befriending the mysterious being Mr. Diggs, you<03e0>may use harvesting points to get components useful<03e0>for customization. Try taking Mr. Diggs to many<03e0>places to see what you can find.
The components that can be harvested differ<03e0>according to the type of harvesting point.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Digging Points<1ce0> have rocks, ore, and gems.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Felling Points<1ce0> have trees and flowers.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Underwater Diving Points<1ce0> have precious metals.<03e0>* <1be0ffbe34ff>Underground Diving Points<1ce0> have natural resources<03e0>  such as water or oil.
Sometimes, special harvest points appear on the map.<03e0>These locations are rumored to have <1be0ffbe34ff>buried treasure<1ce0>.<03e0>The items found here are especially rare. However,<03e0>you can only make one attempt to retrieve them.
Unnaturally good at harvesting items, and almost<03e0>definitely alive, <1be0ffbe34ff>Mr. Diggs<1ce0> can become even better<03e0>at harvesting through practice. The more it tries,<03e0>the more and better quality items it can retrieve.
The number of times Mr. Diggs can harvest is<03e0>displayed as the <1be0ffbe34ff>Digs Count<1ce0>.<03e0>This number can be increased by possessing certain<03e0>items. The count is reset on returning to the World Map<03e0>so feel free to harvest freely.
During harvesting, a <1be0ffbe34ff>Loop Chance<1ce0> may occur<07f003e0>a rare happening when Mr. Diggs's true abilities are<03e0>unlocked, and it harvests to the best of its abilities,<03e0>sometimes finding huge treasure troves. With luck,<03e0>you could find yourself with more items than you<03e0>even know what to do with.
Sometimes, odd things happen to Mr. Diggs, putting you<03e0>on <1be0ffbe34ff>alert<1ce0>. Anything could happen...<03e0>* Rush is covered in a Terrify Aura<03e0>* Rush is covered in a Charm Aura<03e0>* Rush is covered in a Provoke Aura<03e0>* Mr. Diggs's action count goes to minimum<03e0>* Mr. Diggs's action count is restored<03e0>* Nearby monsters are angered
A monster's status can be determined by<03e0>checking the icon above its head.<03e0>Pressing <28e0>722<0000f7>ÿ<000100> left and right calls up<03e0>the target cursor. Placing the target cursor over<03e0>a monster will show its name and stats.
Monsters have three states. You can determine a<03e0>monster's attitude by checking the icon above its head.<03e0>Monsters with <28e0>+**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>0**<d9fffe>ÿ<000100> will flee when you get close.<03e0>Monsters with <28e0>+**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>/**<d8fffe>ÿ<000100> will attack when you get close.<03e0>Monsters with <28e0>+**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>A*<1500daff080000000100> seem calm, but if you get too<03e0>close, who knows what they'll do?
Monsters with <28e0>+**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>2**<d6fffe>ÿ<000100> are completely enraged.<03e0>They will attack you.<03e0>Monsters with <28e0>+**<0000fe>ÿ<00010028e0>,**<dafffe>ÿ<000100> are charmed by Rush.<03e0>They will not attack.<03e0>Monsters in either of these states will follow Rush<03e0>anywhere.
Around the world are incredibly strong beasts who<03e0>are known for their exceptional strength.<03e0>Sometimes it's difficult to tell them from average<03e0>monsters, but if you check their status with your<03e0>target cursor, their name appears in a different<03e0>color than usual<07f0>so beware!
Press <28e03e00>@ <f6>ÿ<00f6ff0100> to Timeshift, slowing the flow<03e0>of time for a short while. When in Timeshift, nearby<03e0>monsters will be marked as encounterable.<03e0>Pulling <28e0>?@ <f6>ÿ<00f6ff0100> while in Timeshift<03e0>will launch a battle with all marked monsters, even<03e0>if the marked monsters are currently out of range.

On menus with scrollbars, pressing <28e0>722<0000f7>ÿ<000100> up or down<03e0>while holding <28e0>;  <0000000000000100> will skip the text by a page at a time.
While in towns, pressing <28e01c00>  <0000000000000100> will return you to the City Map.<03e0>Pressing <28e01c00>  <0000000000000100> a second time will call up the World Map.
Pubs<1ce0> are a great source of information on<03e0>happenings in the world. Even the smallest of<03e0>villages has a pub, a clearinghouse for the latest<03e0>news. <1be0ff4060ff>When in doubt, first speak with the bartender.<1ce003e0>Many characters offering quests gather in pubs.
When you don't have enough members in your party,<03e0>try hiring some muscle at a <1be0ffbe34ff>guild<1ce0>.<03e0>As you progress through the game, stronger and<03e0>more varied mercenaries will become available.
Guild Tasks<1ce0> are completely optional quests.<03e0>All that's needed is to fulfill the conditions for<03e0>them to be completed. Check the task list at guilds<03e0>for more information.
After battle, sometimes friendly units want the spoils<03e0>of your last battle. They do not claim items at<03e0>random, but <1be0ff4060ff>search for items to customize their<1ce003e01be0ff4060ff>equipment<1ce0>. If you give them the items, they will<03e0>have better gear.
When a new union enters the battlefield, the side<03e0>it is supporting is <1be0ffbe34ff>Reinforced<1ce0>. Reinforcement<03e0>may correspond to anything from a large linked<03e0>battle, or the effects of an enemy skill.
Interference<1ce0> is a state in which the player union or<03e0>an ally union forces an enemy union, which has a different<03e0>union targeted for Deadlock, into a Deadlock.<03e0>This is called <1be0ffbe34ff>Interception<1ce0> when done by an enemy union<03e0>to the player union or an ally union.
The game can generally be saved anywhere<03e0>the Party Menu can be opened.<03e0>Game progress can also be saved on<03e0>World and City Maps.
Questgivers are generally found in pubs.<03e0>Talk to the pub staff to hear the latest<03e0>rumors surrounding currently available quests.<03e0>Different rumors can be heard in different towns.
When specific characters join your party,<03e0>you can find and talk to them when visiting<03e0>their hometowns. The conversations you<03e0>have change the more you talk to them<03e0>and help them out.
Even if given the same battle command,<03e0>depending on the unit, the action it<03e0>takes may differ. It is up to you whether<03e0>to place emphasis on the unit or the action<03e0>in question.
Unleashing a Remnant's power or summoning<03e0>a Remnant using Arcana can be done through<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Special Commands<1ce0>. This command appears when<03e0>fighting tough opponents, or when you have<03e0>lots of morale during battle, for example.
Spells referred to as <1be0ffbe34ff>Arcana<1ce0> can be<03e0>unleashed when several units' spells get released<03e0>together. Once an Arcana spell is unleashed,<03e0>it will appear as an option in the Special Commands.
