Hello! Welcome to the Amber Tavern.
Some strange animal or something has been seen<03e0>around the stores on Grants Way. Ooh, if something<03e0>like that were to come here, I don't know what I'd do...
Some soldiers came here, looking for someone...<03e0>It wasn't you, was it?
Hmm? What's with that face?<03e0>Did you get in a fight with someone?<03e007f0>A lovers' spat, perhaps?
It seems those soldiers are back again. It seems they've<03e0>a message from the Marquis of Athlum... They're looking<03e0>for you, right? Come on, you can tell me.
You must be a popular guy...<03e0>Messengers from Athlum are looking for you again.<04e0>I figured you were just your run-of-the-mill cutie...<03e0>Don't tell me you're one of Athlum's generals<03e0>or something?
Poo...boring!<04e0>I thought that by getting a job at the pub I'd be<03e0>able to meet all kinds of cool people, but<03e0>everyone who comes lives in the neighborhood!<04e0>Ahhh...it'd be pretty neat if Lord Qubine came<03e0>here for a drink, for example! Though, I guess<03e0>he's a little young...
The rumor going around Grants Way is that<03e0>lots of soldiers have been gathering in Nagapur.<04e0>You don't think they're getting ready for a war<03e0>or something, do you?<04e0>Even if they were, my lovely tavernkeep, you<03e0>have no need to worry! I would protect you with<03e0>my life!
I cannot believe we were so easily overcome by<03e0>the Conqueror's army! Even so, the Conqueror's<03e0>soldiers weren't anything special, hm?<04e0>Oh! Fair bartender, my delicate bringer of<03e0>spirits, did you see my stunning contribution<03e0>to the city defense?<04e0>You saw me cowering under the counter?<04e0>W-well! I wasn't feeling so well, you see! A bit<03e0>of stomach flu, that's it! Really! Ahahah...hrm.
The Lords hold a meeting of the Congress every<03e0>couple years at the sacred city of Elysion<07f0>you<03e0>know, at the center of the continent.<04e0>But from here, it's a long, hard journey.<04e0>If you're planning on heading to Elysion, make<03e0>sure you're stocked for a long trip.
You ever heard of Balterossa? It's a city in the<03e0>desert to the south. There you can buy weapons<03e0>forged from all sorts of odd materials.<04e0>You should see the markets at least once in<03e0>your life, kid... At least, if you've the skill to<03e0>make it there in one piece.
The Conqueror's army seems to have two main leaders...<04e0>One's an armored giant, the other's a woman;<03e0>pretty, but with a tongue as sharp as her sword.<04e0>Their positions aren't for show, either<07f0>there<03e0>isn't anyone who's been able to best them in<03e0>battle... I couldn't leave a scratch on them.<04e0>The two of them together put out this terrifying<03e0>aura, and leave behind a veritable mountain of<03e0>corpses on the battlefield...<04e0>Those two...they're not ones to trifle with.
Did you see the kind of, er, rough yama sitting<03e0>by himself downstairs?<04e0>He's one of our regulars, but unlike a lot of the<03e0>people here, he's traveled all over and knows a<03e0>lot.<04e0>If you have any questions about other parts of<03e0>the world, try screwing up your courage and<03e0>asking him, okay?<04e0>I know he looks kinda scary, but he's really a<03e0>sweet guy.
When the Conqueror attacked, lots of soldiers<03e0>gathered here in Lamberro District on their way to<03e0>the battlefield.<04e0>But only a few returned... Alive, anyway...<04e0>Oh! But our yamaan regular, he made<03e0>it back alright! Thank goodness...
You wish to know the powerful families in<03e0>Celapaleis? Hmm...<04e0>The House of Nielsen, the House of Zita... Those<03e0>two and the House of Gilles-Barre are the most<03e0>well-known, I believe.<04e0>However, since rule of Celapaleis passed to<03e0>Lord Qubine, the Gilles-Barres have fallen into<03e0>a deep decline.<04e0>Their patriarch, Count Gierven, passed away some<03e0>years ago... It's said that was the reason for the<03e0>House's fall.<04e0>Conversely, the Nielsens have risen in standing,<03e0>especially after Count Gierven's daughter was<03e0>married into the family.<04e0>Well. Even the high-born have drama, hmm?
Ooh... I've fallen, hard...<04e0>Fallen in love, of course!<04e0>With one of the Celapaleian guards... He's beautiful,<03e0>his eyes sparkle like the Umbermarici... I can't really<03e0>see under his helmet, but I just know it!<04e0>But for now, it's just a one-sided love... I'm so<03e0>worked up I feel like I could burst! *sigh*
Ahh, I'm the happiest girl in the whole world!<04e0>I asked out my crush, and he said yes!<04e0>He's one of the Celapaleian guards... His eyes sparkle<03e0>like the Umbermarici itself...but I'm the only one<03e0>allowed to peek under his helmet.<04e0>Does everyone feel this blissful when they're in<03e0>love? If I could, I'd share some of my happiness<03e0>with you...
...<04e0>Fate is a cruel mistress.<03e0>She snatched him away from me, forever...<04e0>Before he left, he asked me to forget him if the<03e0>worst happened...<04e0>Idiot...<03e0>As if I could ever forget him...<04e0>This is his sword...the only thing of his that<03e0>returned from the battlefield. Would you take it?<04e0>I was going to throw it away, but after talking to<03e0>you, I thought maybe you should have it...<03e0>Strange, isn't it...
His sword will certainly help you protect your friends.<03e0>I have to believe in that...
The gods have smiled upon me!<03e0>My beloved was dispatched to the Nest of Eagles,<03e0>but was able to return safely.<04e0>He said the army was devastated, but at the moment<03e0>all hope seemed lost, Athlum swept in and turned<03e0>the tide.<04e0>Oh! Now that I think of it, his sword... I was on<03e0>my way to sell it, but instead, let me give it to you.<04e0>He's resigned from the army, and we're to be married!<03e0>This sword has protected my fiance all this time<07f003e0>surely it will be a blessing to you as well.
Oh, has the blade been useful? It protected my beloved<03e0>for a long time. Surely it will be a blessing to you as<03e0>well.
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...<04e0>You there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah...why?<09e008e0010000000000>You're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
*snort* Playing dumb won't get you anywhere<07f0>if you're<03e0>playing at all.<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...<04e0>You're Rush Sykes, right?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup, I'm Rush!<09e008e0010000000000>You've got the wrong guy.
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.<04e0>He says he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>information-gathering, and that you should come to<03e0>the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> for details.<04e0>Got it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,<03e0>though<07f0>you're not in trouble...not with us at least.<03e0>Lord David's put out a summons for you.<04e0>Apparently he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>your information-gathering, so he'd like you to come<03e0>to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> so he can share it with you.<04e0>Don't make him wait too long, okay, kid? Or else you<03e0>might end up in trouble with us after all... Just joking!
Ohh! That valiant form...<04e0>You must be Rush Sykes, are you not?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The one and only!<09e008e0010000000000>Depends on who's asking.
Well met!<03e0>David, Marquis of Athlum requests that you come<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Athlum Castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!<03e0>I bring a message from Lord David. He requests that<03e0>you come to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Oho? But it is young Rush.<04e0>I'm afraid I have no time to chat. I am to meet a<03e0>maiden as beautiful as a blooming rose.
Do you know the subcommander of the Order<03e0>of Melphina, the fiery Ophelia?<04e0>I hear she is quite unlike the stodgy old commander<07f003e0>instead, a beauty in the flower of youth, blazing with a<03e0>passion for justice...and perhaps for other things as well.<04e0>Ahh, I should like to be the one to tame such a<03e0>tigress. I wonder, is it difficult to join this Order<03e0>of Melphina?
Ophelia, subcommander of the Order of Melphina.<03e0>Someday I shall make your acquaintance...and feel<03e0>the flames of your passion for myself.
Do you know the Lady Charlotte di Balterossa?<03e0>She is the lovely young heir to the desert<03e0>queendom.<04e0>Unlike that arrogant harpy of a mother, Charlotte<03e0>is a gentle and delicate flower...a true desert bloom.<04e0>I wonder how I may pick that flower and raise it<03e0>in a garden of my own...
The sweet princess, Charlotte di Balterossa...<03e0>Someday I will draw near enough to whisper sweet<03e0>nothings into your ear...
Do you know the goddess of Elysion,<03e0>Marion Marshall?<04e0>Not even the legendary desert queen could compare<03e0>to her greatness. It is said her beauty was enough<03e0>to set even the most stoic of hearts atremble.<04e0>If only I could lay eyes upon her, even once...<03e0>Yea, time itself plots against our romance,<03e0>yet I am certain I can find a way to surpass it...
The goddess of Elysion, Marion Marshall...<03e0>If only I could ford the streams of time to gaze<03e0>upon your beauty...
The beloved daughter of Celapaleis' storied house<03e0>of Gilles-Barre, Violet... She is noble as the rose.<04e0>Just the sight of her fighting for the glory of her<03e0>family, continuing the work her late father carried<03e0>for so long, moves my heart...<04e0>...<04e0>Shall I be frank for a moment?<04e0>I'm the third son of a poor family from Athlum.<03e0>There was no place for me in my home, so I<03e0>fled at my first opportunity.<04e0>However, on my own I realized I had little with which<03e0>to make my way. As you know well, my skill lies not<03e0>in acts of valor. My single talent is a pretty face.<04e0>Heh, no need to look so surprised. Act how I may,<03e0>I have a full understanding of the reality of my<03e0>situation. And I have taken advantage of it as well.<04e0>Thus I have made my way through the world by<03e0>pleasuring ladies and romancing maidens. Never<03e0>has one captured my heart.<04e0>Never before now...<03e0>Violet... For some reason I cannot keep her from<03e0>my thoughts. This has never happened before...<04e0>...<04e0>Forgive my going on. If nothing else, this is no<03e0>conversation for children.<04e0>Though, I had imagined Baron Nielsen to be a<03e0>base cur, while in truth he is surprisingly<03e0>broad-minded... Ah, I must let it go.<04e0>Rush, forgive my candidness. I had not intended<03e0>to speak of such odd things. Though, you are a<03e0>surprisingly good listener. It is appreciated.<04e0>Rush. Once again I pledge myself to your service.<03e0>I promise to work to the best of my abilities. As for<03e0>the extent of those abilities, I make no guarantees.
Rush Sykes! A pleasure to see you once again.<03e0>Have you need of me? If you've any troubles with the<03e0>fairer sex, then you may request my services any time.
Absolutely nothing interesting is going on lately... *sigh*
You know Baron Nielsen, right?<03e0>His wife's run off again, can you believe it?<03e0>They really must not get along!
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ah, poor Baron. He's one of our regulars, you know.
Ooh, that priggish old guy with the mustache, huh?<03e0>He always fusses at me...
I don't want to believe it, but it seems like there's<03e0>some crazy woman plotting to assassinate<03e0>Lord Qubine...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I'd heard a similar rumor from Baron Nielsen...
What? What what?<03e0>Sounds fishy to me...
So, apparently the desert princess has been sneaking<03e0>out of the castle pretty regularly to meet some<03e0>guy she's been mooning over.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I wish I could sneak away too...<03e0>Life isn't made to be spent working!
Hey hey, I'm working really hard here,<03e0>so you work hard too!
Hey! So, the desert princess has eloped<03e0>with her man!
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ahh, to drop everything and elope? Something<03e0>about it just sounds so romantic...
You just want an excuse not to come to work!
Seems relations between Balterossa and Royotia have<03e0>taken a nosedive. All the families of the soldiers are<03e0>getting worried since the armies are being mobilized...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
What about the poor princess? Wasn't she in love<03e0>with the boy from Royotia?
Guess they broke up.
So there's supposed to be something the Imperator<03e0>sealed out in the great swamp... Problem is, the seal's<03e0>broken. Could be the entrance to some other world...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Some things are just meant to be left alone...<03e0>No need to be bringing all this up now, right?
Monsters are popping out of it!
There's a Forest Maiden who's so attuned to<03e0>the Knight she's bound to, she can like, see through<03e0>his eyes or hear things he's heard.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I'm bound to you, so let's go take a vacation!<03e0>Hmm? You really want to go now, yes?
No! Go by yourself!
The Forest Maidens and the Order of Melphina<03e0>are mobilizing... Seems something's happened to<03e0>the Last Leaf in Crookfen.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Whatever. If monsters want it so bad,<03e0>let them have it.
Irresponsible, much?
It's almost time for Kosmosfest! But apparently<03e0>the Cosmos Maiden hasn't made it to Nagapur yet.<03e0>Seems like maybe she's in trouble...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Why don't they just get a substitute maiden?
Do they have one?
So the Cosmos Maiden made it, and they started<03e0>the Kosmosfest alright. Usually nothing much happens,<03e0>but this time it was interrupted by monsters.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Why not just let the monsters join in?
If it's a fighting festival, sure!
Some old-fashioned-looking woman is looking to hire<03e0>bodyguards, I hear. She's supposed to be hanging<03e0>out at the pub near the canal.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Hmm. There's a canal here in Celapaleis, but<03e0>something makes me think this girl is in some<03e0>other town.
Wait, what? We have a canal?
Hey, are you into antiques?<03e0>Apparently a lot of the treasures of the Old<03e0>Kingdoms are turning up on the black market.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ah, you picked up some things from Undelwalt a while<03e0>back, didn't you... So, were those from the black market?
Ack! They were from the pub!
Some guy is looking for these three stones that're<03e0>really important to the desert.<03e0>Historically significant, or something.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ah, maybe I can help out.<03e0>I've tossed around plenty of rocks.
Not the ones here, special ones!
Some guy into ancient magick is looking for people to<03e0>help out with his research. Seems he's on the verge<03e0>of making some huge discovery.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Sounds boring. I'll pass.
Okay!
Apparently some monster sealed by the Imperator<03e0>has appeared. It's really got people spooked, saying<03e0>it's the end of the world, and all.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Well...c'est la vie.
That's so harsh...
Some amnesiac is wandering around the cities in<03e0>the desert, looking for something that could<03e0>regain his memory.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
He should concentrate on making new memories,<03e0>not finding old ones.
Oh! That's surprisingly moving...
Recently people've been seeing this infamous bandit<03e0>around Athlum. Apparently he's waiting around for<03e0>someone but no one's brave enough to ask who.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
An infamous bandit? ...It couldn't be Loki, could it?<03e0>Goodness, what has Athlum come to?
Loki? Never heard of him.
There's a goddess statue in the Robelia Ruins that'll<03e0>let you find someone, no matter how far away they are.<03e0>Some kid looking for his sister is interested in it...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Say you've a statue like that while fighting through<03e0>a love triangle...<03e0>What happens then?
Go halfsies?
Some weird...thing's been lurking around Celapaleis,<03e0>giving people the willies.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ah<07f0>I've seen it! Ugh, it was terrible...
It was cute!
There's a murderer on the loose in the capital!
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I hope they catch him as soon as possible...
Me too. Ooh, scary...
There's some massive yama looking for stuff...<03e0>But he's kinda out there so people've been trying to<03e0>keep out of his way.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
It's best not to associate with people like that.
Yeah, I guess...<03e0>I kinda feel bad for him though!
Some white qsiti's been looking for a magickal book.<03e0>People seem to think he looks familiar, but no one's<03e0>been able to place him.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Magick...that's that ancient, strange power, right?<03e0>It can't be learnt without a lot of study.
I want ancient powers! But I don't want to study...
There're these twins that've turned up as mercenaries<03e0>lately...good ones, too. The one girl is supposed to be<03e0>a real cool customer<07f0>both in looks, and in attitude.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ahh, I wish I were a twin. Whenever I felt like ditching<03e0>work, I could switch off with her.
You realize that when you're switching off, you don't<03e0>get paid, right?
Some guy out in the Great Sand Sea's been looking for<03e0>challengers for some sort of game<07f0>but he seems<03e0>the type not to deal with regular people.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Well then, let's not deal with him, either.
Works for me!
Some old warrior's crossed the Great Sand Sea,<03e0>looking for a special sword.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
No one can cross the Great Sand Sea alone.
Huh? But what about this guy?
The guards of Ghor have all sworn to follow their ruler<03e0>for as long as they live.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Men are fond of that sort of thing.
Yeah... It's pretty cool, don't you think?
The Honeywell family is known as a super-dedicated<03e0>family. Some say that with their support you can<03e0>do anything.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Like General Emma, right? I met her once when I was<03e0>a child. She was beautiful.
She's pretty striking now!<03e0>But yeah, I wonder what she looked like when<03e0>she was young.
Apparently Athlum's General Torgal is supposed to<03e0>have some things in his past that're coming back to<03e0>haunt him. Stuff's supposed to be going on in Royotia...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Torgal is that sovani, yes?<03e0>For a sovani to serve a mitra, something significant<03e0>must have happened in his past...
Huh... Do you think he owes money?
It's about time for the Tournament of Heroes to start<03e0>up again. It's pretty well-known among the types with<03e0>fighting spirit.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Ooh, those sorts of things are not for me.
But I bet I'd be okay, right?
Apparently there's some mystic academy that's been<03e0>spitting out skilled magi for years.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Come to think of it, how's your homework<03e0>coming along?
It's...going? Sort of? Not really?
Athlum's been going through some tough times, and<03e0>people are worried about the new matriarch of<03e0>the Honeywell clan because she's so young.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I think she'll be fine.<03e0>She's a carbon copy of General Emma.
Huh, so the young General Emma looked just<03e0>like General Emmy!
Recently there's been gossip about Lord David's<03e0>love interests...or lack thereof.<03e0>He's never been connected with anybody.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Really? I could swear there was that one person<03e0>a while back...
What? What? Really?<03e0>If you know something, you've gotta dish!
The old head of the Academy's been seen in pubs<03e0>across the continent lately. I guess it stands to reason<03e0>she'd want to drown her sorrows after what happened.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Really, what people should be asking is why she was<03e0>in charge of the Academy in the first place...
The whole thing's pretty fishy.
Dr. Sykes has been seen going in and out of Athlum<03e0>Castle lately. Maybe there's been some new discovery!
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I heard that their son was staying at Athlum Castle.
Oh, guess he volunteered for the army, huh.
Some unidentified flying object's been spotted<03e0>swooping around Wyrmskeep.<03e0>It's totally been freaking everyone out...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
It's...not going to come around here, is it?
If it does, let's catch it!
Some hot-blooded female warrior is trying to hunt<03e0>down that group causing trouble in Crookfen.<03e0>But it's against her boss's wishes...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Hunt them down...but for whose benefit?
Yeah...<03e0>Sounds like she's doing it for herself more than<03e0>anything...
Some monster army's appeared in the Great Sand Sea.<03e0>They're so powerful that everyone in Balterossa<03e0>is totally in despair...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Goodness! What could possibly be going on?
Is the desert really gonna be okay?
According to ancient historians, there's something<03e0>dangerous enough to destroy entire cities sealed<03e0>within the volcano...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
And this has been kept secret all this time?<03e0>Why not tell everyone?
I guess they were hoping it'd stay sealed so it<03e0>wouldn't matter.
No one knows anything about the stuff going on inside<03e0>the volcano, nor does anyone know how to find out...<03e0>But, the Marquis of Royotia might have some ideas...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Certainly the Marquis will have some sort of plan.
Wonder what it is? Probably "kill it with fire"!
You know there's a town without anyone running it?<03e0>The old ruler's sons are fighting over the seat of power.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Obviously they should just both rule.
If not, I'll do it!
When you're out in the desert, you can hear this sad,<03e0>lonely voice crying from beneath the Great Sand Sea.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Hey! You know I don't like those sorts of stories...
But it's interesting, don't you think?
A long time ago, there used to be a famed hero that<03e0>lived in the Great Sand Sea.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Right, right.<03e0>We know that the majority of what you say is<03e0>completely made up.
It is not!
So I was walking through town and heard this guy all<03e0>"you gotta believe me! If you look at the pillars in<03e0>the Great Sand Sea, then...g-g-gra<07f0>!"
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Hey! Enough with all that, already!
But it's funnn!
Some crackpot old scientist has been wandering<03e0>around Melphina. If you go over there, you probably<03e0>should stay away, he's giving people strange looks.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
What sorts of things could he want people for?
To experiment on them, I guess...
The cafe out in Baaluk's supposedly infested with<03e0>bugs...they followed the guy all the way from the desert.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
And they still get customers?
They're totally gonna lose their restaurant license!
Nagapur's been increasingly unsafe. Just recently<03e0>another bunch of kids have gone missing...
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Kidnappings... Something like that was going on<03e0>in Athlum recently, wasn't it...
Oh yeah, General Blocter busted the group, right?<03e0>Wonder if these are the same guys?
Adventurers have gotten into trading the different<03e0>treasures they find on their trips. Apparently,<03e0>Royotia's the main hub for the fad.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
I'd never heard of that... Where is all this going on?
If they're using trade routes, probably mainly between<03e0>Balterossa and Royotia, I'd say.
Royotian merchants are getting frustrated with<03e0>Balterossa...they control all of their trade goods.
That's the latest scoop, anyway!
Definitely! Royotian things only get here after<03e0>passing through Balterossa and Elysion, so they're<03e0>always incredibly expensive!
It'd be a lot easier if they came straight here,<03e0>you know?
Some yamaan mercenary's out looking for a partner.<03e0>Could be a good way to make a few G.

A mercenary hiring other mercenaries?

Some guy with a hot-and-cold personality's just<03e0>shown up in Celapaleis. He'll seem really sweet and<03e0>then suddenly turn rough at the drop of a hat.

That's one of our customers, yes?
Yeah... He looked really sad, too...

So, a guy was telling me about this mysterious<03e0>woman he saw. He said she looked like she had<03e0>the whole world on her shoulders...

Someday, I want to join!
The Silver Falcons have been going after what's left<03e0>of the Conqueror's army.<03e0>Who knows what those guys could be up to...
