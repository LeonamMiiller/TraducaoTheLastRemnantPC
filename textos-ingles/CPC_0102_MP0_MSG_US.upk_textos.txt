This is the Lamberro District of Celapaleis. Farther down<03e0>the street you can see the Guild. It's a place where<03e0>many skilled adventurers gather.<04e0>Over here is the Amber Tavern, the local pub.<03e0>It's very popular with some types...<04e0>Oh, I don't mean how you think<07f0>apparently the<03e0>beautiful barkeep is the Amber's big draw.

To think that anyone would attack Celapaleis!<04e0>Many of the strong warriors at the guild headed<03e0>to the Nest of Eagles only to come back<03e0>terribly wounded<07f0>or not at all...<04e0>Ugh, it makes me shiver even to remember it...<03e0>What are we to do if we're attacked again?
The Conqueror's army was defeated<07f0>completely<03e0>defeated, wasn't it?<04e0>I heard at the Amber that soldiers from the<03e0>Conqueror's army were spotted in the woods to<03e0>the north.<04e0>I don't want to believe such a rumor, but...<04e0>Adding to that, Lord Qubine is ill... Terrible<03e0>things are all around, it seems...

A long long time ago here in Celapaleis, there<03e0>was a really pretty stone.<04e0>It was so pretty that people were totally<03e0>mesmerized by it...enough to do evil things.<03e0>Pretty soon the town was in trouble.<04e0>But one day a traveler came through town, and<03e0>saw the stone, and bound it.<04e0>From then on, it didn't do anything else bad,<03e0>and everyone was happy.<04e0>Whaaat, you still don't know what I'm talking<03e0>about? It's the story of the Umbermarici! Man,<03e0>you're stupid! Everybody here knows that!

*sniffle sniffle*<03e0>Th-that was so scary!<04e0>Th-they brought back the soldiers, an' they were<03e0>all hurt<07f0>hurt bad... *sniffle*<04e0>But...the bad guys ran away! The Umbermarici<03e0>scared 'em off, I bet!<04e0>The Umbermarici always protects us!
Hey mister, what'll we do? I heard some rumors<03e0>about the nobles...like, that the Duke is real<03e0>sick!<04e0>What if he has to break his bind with the<03e0>Umbermarici<07f0>and it makes everybody turn bad<03e0>like in the old days?<04e0>I don't want that to happen!<03e0>Stupid Umbermarici!

His Highness, Lord Qubine may look young, but<03e0>he is quite adept at mystic arts.<04e0>I have heard there are rabble-rousers within<03e0>the Ghor castle guard who are so afraid of his<03e0>strength that they spread rumors about it...<04e0>Outlandish claims like Lord Qubine is an alien<03e0>or some Academy-produced magickal boy or<03e0>something... Ridiculous.<04e0>Of course, what else could be expected to come<03e0>from a town like that?<04e0>Those uncouth boors are lucky to be able to string<03e0>two sentences together... It's certainly not worth<03e0>worrying about what they think.

General Honeywell of Athlum has fallen in<03e0>battle... She was well known as a true and<03e0>valiant warrior. It is a regrettable loss.<04e0>Here in Celapaleis the ruler does not have<03e0>anyone to support him.<04e0>Our strength is based on Lord Qubine's<03e0>mystical power and direction.<04e0>If something were to happen to him, who knows<03e0>what would happen to us all...
Lord Qubine's condition is getting worse by<03e0>the day.<04e0>Until now, the prime minister and army leaders<03e0>have strutted like the cocks of the walk... Now<03e0>they run around like their heads were cut off.<04e0>They're completely worthless<07f0>without a ruler<03e0>they can do nothing.<04e0>But, we, the people of Celapaleis, can do little<03e0>more...<04e0>All that's left is to hope and pray for Lord<03e0>Qubine's recovery...
You here from Athlum? Ahh...how ya like seeing<03e0>a real city? Celapaleis ain't anything like your<03e0>backwater hole.<04e0>At least you make a good guard dog, haw haw!<03e0>'S thanks to Athlum that those Ghor scumbags<03e0>don't try anything.<04e0>Or at least, if they did, they'd have to go<03e0>through you first, haw haw!<04e0>Heh, well, keep up the good work, Athlum<03e0>schmucks!

The hell is going on? Some jerkwads calling<03e0>themselves the Conquerors trekked all the way<03e0>from BFE to attack us!<04e0>And where the hell were you, Athlum? Blocking<03e0>that shit is the only reason we keep you around!<04e0>...Don't tell me you let the Conqueror waltz through<03e0>you to Celapaleis just to be a dick!
Dammit... Duke Qubine's gotten sick, and the town's<03e0>gone to hell along with him...<04e0>And to make matters worse, the new Congress<03e0>chairman is the damned Duke of Ghor!<04e0>How a meathead like that became chairman's a<03e0>mystery to me<07f0>and anyone with half a brain.
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...<04e0>You there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah...why?<09e008e0010000000000>You're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
*snort* Playing dumb won't get you anywhere<07f0>if you're<03e0>playing at all.<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...<04e0>You're Rush Sykes, right?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup, I'm Rush!<09e008e0010000000000>Nope, I'm, uh, someone else.
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.<04e0>He says he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>information-gathering, and that you should come to<03e0>the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> for details.<04e0>Got it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,<03e0>though<07f0>you're not in trouble...not with us at least.<03e0>Lord David's put out a summons for you.<04e0>Apparently he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>your information-gathering, so he'd like you to come<03e0>to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> so he can share it with you.<04e0>Don't make him wait too long, okay, kid? Or else you<03e0>might end up in trouble with us after all... Just joking!
Ohh! That valiant form...<04e0>You must be Rush Sykes, are you not?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The one and only!<09e008e0010000000000>Depends on who's asking.
Well met!<03e0>David, Marquis of Athlum requests that you come<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Athlum Castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!<03e0>I bring a message from Lord David. He requests that<03e0>you come to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Oh, hello.<03e0>I have a bit of a headache...<03e0>I'm sorry, but could you let me be for a while?
Rush, I completely understand how you feel about<03e0>Irina.<04e0>I had a sister as well<07f0>my twin, Kate.<03e0>She was completely opposite to me in personality...<03e0>She died some years ago, though...
I had a sister too<07f0>my twin, Kate.<03e0>But she died years ago...<03e0>She always acted like my complete opposite.
Oh, it's you...<03e0>Lately, I've been thinking about my sister a lot.<04e0>Kate died in a terrible accident.<03e0>I wasn't able to save her...<03e0>I... I just...<04e0>Ah<07f0>ahh, I'm sorry.<03e0>I didn't mean to bring up such a heavy topic...<04e0>Hey, you don't need to look so sorry for me.<03e0>This all happened a long time ago...<04e0>...<04e0>Ugh, men, always harping on about the past...<03e0>You. Who are you, Rush or whatever? Tell this<03e0>bonehead to hurry up and get over me, alright?<04e0>...<04e0>...What...did I just black out? Urg...<03e0>I'm sorry, I don't seem to be feeling well. Could<03e0>you leave me alone for a while?
Even though she died years ago, I just can't get Kate<03e0>out of my head... I'm sure if she were here she'd fuss<03e0>at me for being foolish...
Ohh, you again. Up for hearing more bitching, eh?<03e0>I mean, I can't think of any other reason you'd<03e0>wanna chat. ...Guess it sucks for you, too, eh?<04e0>I mean, look at this guy. Rhagoh's been letting<03e0>himself be haunted by the past for years. What<03e0>a pathetic little brother...<04e0>It'd be a hell of a lot easier for us both if he'd<03e0>just forget about me and move on.<04e0>...<04e0>Rush...? When did you get here?<03e0>I was having a dream about my sister Kate.<03e0>She told me I should forget about her...<04e0>But<07f0>that was just a dream, right?
Oh, hello, Rush.<03e0>I dreamt of my sister again, but she told me to<03e0>forget all about her! How mean...
Rush! Thank you so much.<03e0>Thanks to you, I was able to be reunited with my<03e0>other half...I was able to bring back Kate.<04e0>I know she says I should have forgotten about<03e0>her, but I'm certain that she's wanted me to<03e0>search for her the whole time. Yes...I'm sure of it.<04e0>And being tenacious enough to force herself<03e0>into my consciousness...that definitely seems<03e0>like Kate.<04e0>Rush, if it's alright, I'd like to continue to travel<03e0>with you. Kate does as well, of course. Please, let<03e0>me know anytime you need something.
Hi, Rush!<04e0>I fought with Kate for the first time in a long while.<03e0>It sounds kind of strange, but I really missed it...<03e0>I didn't win, but then again I never have...
What...you looking for a fight?<03e0>Keep gawking at me like that and I'll relieve you<03e0>of your teeth.
What's your problem? You look like you've seen a<03e0>ghost. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I'm 100% flesh<03e0>and blood, pal.
The hell's wrong with you? You look like you<03e0>saw a ghost.
Rhagoh?<03e0>Yeah, we're cool. Nothing for you to worry about.<04e0>Just a bit ago we had a fight over lunch.<03e0>Obviously, I won.<04e0>So, of course we're fine. Isn't that what they say,<03e0>friendship is fighting like cats and dogs?<04e0>...<04e0>Yeah, we're fine...we should be just fine, Rhagoh and me.
Rhagoh and me are getting along just fine.<03e0>Nothing for you to worry your empty little head about,<03e0>anyway.
What do you want? I am not in a good mood. If you<03e0>haven't got a damned good reason to chit-chat,<03e0>I suggest you leave me the hell alone.<04e0>...<04e0>Sorry.<03e0>It's just that<07f0> Hell, I'll just tell you.<04e0>Thing is... I'm not really<07f0>me. I mean, it's not like I'm<03e0>a clone or a ghost or anything ridiculous like that.<04e0>How it worked is that I'm the Kate from Rhagoh's<03e0>memories, made flesh by the Remnant Flâchonelle,<03e0>if that makes any sense, which it probably doesn't.<04e0>Either way, for the most part I'm really Kate, but still<03e0>sort of...not.<04e0>At first, I didn't give a damn. If I was enough for<03e0>Rhagoh, it was enough for me.<04e0>Just, as time's gone on, it's been freaking me out.<03e0>I mean, what if everything I do isn't because I wanna<03e0>do it, but because I'm Rhagoh's idealized vision of me?<04e0>What am I?<03e0>What should I do with myself?<04e0>...<04e0>Huh...guess it's a bitch for you to have to deal with<03e0>this shit, too. But...thanks. It felt good to get some of<03e0>this off my chest.
Thanks for letting me vent. I feel better getting that<03e0>off my chest.
Hey.<04e0>Since we talked last time, I've been spending some<03e0>time away from Rhagoh... Been doing some thinking.<04e0>It was kinda nice to be away. Had me thinking I<03e0>didn't need to be worrying so much after all.<04e0>I am me...and that's okay. Trying to force myself<03e0>to act like somebody else wants is only gonna make<03e0>all of us pissed, eh?<04e0>So, I'm just gonna live as me. Might be a little different<03e0>than what Rhagoh was thinking, but I am Kate and<03e0>Kate's gotta be true to herself.<04e0>...Damn, but this is confusing. Anyway, thanks,<03e0>Rush. Talking with you really helped me sort<03e0>all this out.
Heya, Rush!<03e0>Huhhh, you actually look busy. We can chat later, then.
