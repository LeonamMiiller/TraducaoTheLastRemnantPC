I went to see the Remnant here...<04e0>It's the Remnant of Fear, Gwayn... Its power<03e0>was so great and fierce that it razed Nagapur<03e0>in an instant.<04e0>This was the first time I'd seen the Gwayn in<03e0>person. Seeing it with my own eyes, feeling its<03e0>presence...<04e0>All I could think was that Remnants are not<03e0>meant to be our tools, or even our allies.<04e0>Like the Gwayn, they may seem quiet, or even to<03e0>watch over us, but one misstep can bring the full<03e0>brunt of that terrible power down upon us all...<04e0>Great power only leads to destruction. I wonder<03e0>if we are really meant to live alongside<03e0>Remnants as we do...
