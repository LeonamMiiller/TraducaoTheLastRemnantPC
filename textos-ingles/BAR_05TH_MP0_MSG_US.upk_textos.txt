Baaluk is currently without a lord.<03e0>The two sons of the previous lord do nothing but<03e0>argue over who is more fit for the position...<04e0>The closest we've got to a ruler is Wyngale. He's<03e0>protected this town for a long time. But without<03e0>a lord, who knows when there might be a Collapse?
This Brimuslabus is gone...<03e0>I pray that things will change for the better.
It's hard to believe it's come to this... But I was born and<03e0>raised in this town. Reckon I'll stay with it to the end.<04e0>It's like all the stories said... The Brimuslabus was the<03e0>guardian angel to us all...
There is no way we can ever fully thank Wyngale for what<03e0>he's done.<04e0>The Brimuslabus may be gone, but there's still a future<03e0>for this town...it's one we're all willing to work together<03e0>to make.
The next leader of Baaluk is gonna be me! My<03e0>little brother's such an idiot he tried milking<03e0>bulls! Like I'm gonna leave Baaluk to him!
The next leader of Baaluk is gonna be me!<03e0>But so long as the Brimuslabus's gone, I gotta<03e0>figure something out to take care of this fix we're in...
I figure I was acting like a kid before. Wyngale saved<03e0>the town and gave us a second chance...<03e0>I'm gonna cooperate with my little bro from now on.
I-I'm going to be the next ruler of Baaluk... I<03e0>hope! My older brother is too hot-headed... I-I<03e0>don't want to leave the Brimuslabus to him!
I can hardly believe this is happening...
I can't tell you how many nights I spent with my<03e0>brother, trying to figure out how to save the town...<04e0>And that's when I realized just how much he<03e0>cares about Baaluk, and what he'd sacrifice for it...<04e0>From now on, we're gonna think of how we can<03e0>help out the village<07f0>together.
