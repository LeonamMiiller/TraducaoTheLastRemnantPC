This is the Town Square, where the proud people of<03e0>Athlum come to relax and unwind.<04e0>Anything you need from accessories to weapons can<03e0>be acquired here.<04e0>I recommend you take a look around.
The soldiers who went to the Robelia Ruins still<03e0>haven't returned... If only Lady Emma could investigate...
What's wrong? You look lost. If it's information you need,<03e0>check out the <1be0ffbe34ff>pub<1ce0>. If you're looking to expand your party,<03e0>check out the <1be0ffbe34ff>guild<1ce0>.
Facing the Conqueror was like gnats trying to<03e0>take down the Gwayn. We were completely<03e0>overwhelmed...<04e0>At the very least, I can stand watch over the<03e0>square that Lady Emma gave her life to protect.
The Congress has reconvened, and Lord David<03e0>is busy searching for new Remnants.<04e0>The merchants here are doing their part as<03e0>well<07f0>mobilizing through stocking all-new<03e0>inventory.
Everyone's saying that Athlum getting its independence<03e0>is all thanks to the hard work Lord David's been doing.<04e0>That being the case, I'm going to do my best to<03e0>uphold the pride of Athlum by watching over this square!
I wanted to help out with the strike against the<03e0>Conqueror as well...<04e0>But someone had to protect the Town Square...<03e0>I'll do what I can from here, so I'm depending on you<03e0>guys to take care of the rest!
You must be Rush Sykes.<03e0>I've heard a lot about you from Lord David.<04e0>Everyone's quite the oddball, but they're all<03e0>good men. If you're ever in need of help,<03e0>you know where to find it.
This Remnant is the heart of our town.<03e0>It's called the Valeria Heart.<03e0>It represents bravery.<04e0>Long ago, this town was victim to many disasters.<04e0>But one day, a massive sword fell from the sky, and<03e0>from that moment on, nothing else troubled the<03e0>land...or so the legend goes.<04e0>Thus, as long as the Valeria Heart exists,<03e0>Athlum will not fall.<04e0>If you are ever discouraged, pray to the Valeria Heart.<03e0>Your spirit will be set at ease.
Lately, it seems there are many tales of a brute<03e0>calling himself the Conqueror making trouble...<04e0>It's nothing to worry of here in Athlum.<03e0>Trust in the Valeria Heart.<03e0>We have nothing to fear.
[[3rd Level Message]]
The Valeria Heart was taken from us...<04e0>But, the Remnant was meant to protect us from all<03e0>evils threatening us. That...that couldn't have been<03e0>mere superstition...
From the merchants, I hear that Nagapur has been<03e0>destroyed.<04e0>I've lived my life thinking of Remnants like guardian<03e0>angels here to protect us. Now, I'm not so certain...
I never imagined I would live to see the day Athlum was<03e0>under her own control...<04e0>Indeed, there is more to life than suffering.
I can only pray that we'll all get through this safely.
Athlum's ruler, Lord David, genuinely cares about his<03e0>people and listens to our needs with a caring heart.<04e0>The former Marquis died when Lord David was still<03e0>really young, but even so, he's grown to be a great<03e0>ruler in his own right!<04e0>He's even bound the strongest weapon in all of Athlum,<03e0>the Gae Bolg. I can't think of anyone who'd be more<03e0>appropriate for the job.
Hey... This isn't common knowledge, but I can tell you're<03e0>into the Marquis as much as I am, so I'll let you in on it...<04e0>They say that each time the former Marquis used the<03e0>Gae Bolg in battle, it ate away a little bit of his soul!<03e0>That's why he died so young.<04e0>Now, Lord David is working hard and fighting to protect<03e0>all of us... Who knows how much damage it's doing?<04e0>I really hope that peace is reached quickly, so Lord<03e0>David can return to us with both body and soul intact!
Before General Honeywell...before we lost her, she was<03e0>always at Lord David's side. They must have shared a<03e0>deep bond...<04e0>Now that she's passed on, who knows how painful this<03e0>all must be for Lord David?<04e0>I wonder if there's anything I could do to ease his pain...
Even after losing the Valeria Heart and Lady Emma,<03e0>Lord David hasn't missed a beat, going out to the<03e0>battlefield and leading the troops.<04e0>It's moving, isn't it? He's going to lead Athlum to a<03e0>bright future, I just know it.
Now that Athlum's reached independence, it means Lord<03e0>David will have to take on a huge responsibility...<04e0>But I'm sure he can handle it. He could even surpass<03e0>the late Marquis in greatness... With Lord David at the<03e0>helm, Athlum's future is shining bright, no doubt about it!
War with the Conqueror... No doubt Lord David only came<03e0>to this decision after a long period of heavy thought.<04e0>All I can do now is trust in him, and hope that he can<03e0>take care of this quickly and safely, so we can put this<03e0>all behind us and move to a new future.
That strike on the monsters on the Yamarn Plain was a<03e0>big success. Lord David and his Gae Bolg knocked off<03e0>those monsters in one fell swoop!<04e0>Yep yep, no one can stand up to good ol' Athlum!<04e0>Heck, I think this calls for a celebration!<03e0>Hey, pops! Gimme a cut of your finest meat!
Oh man... Everyone around here's been gabbing non-stop<03e0>about some ominous-sounding guy called the Conqueror<03e0>or something.<04e0>Apparently he's going around and attacking countries<03e0>left and right! Who knows how much longer before we<03e0>get dragged into it...<04e0>Hey, pops! Get me something healthy...<03e0>I think I'm gonna need it!
Unbelievable!<03e0>Lady Emma...dead!?<04e0>How could that even happen? Athlum's Four Generals<03e0>are the strongest fighters there are... Right, pops?
So, word is that that new Congress chairman, Ghor or<03e0>whatever, he's told Lord David to go off to find more<03e0>massive Remnants.<04e0>Seriously, are you just supposed to be stumbling over<03e0>them as you walk down the street?<04e0>If they were that easy to find, you'd see them in shops<03e0>down here all the time, eh, pops?
Lord David is just amazing! I can't believe he really got<03e0>independence for Athlum!<04e0>Pops, gimme your finest cut of meat! We're feasting<03e0>tonight!
Conqueror Schmonqueror, who's afraid of that cheese-<03e0>head? Not us! Nobody puts Athlum in a corner!<04e0>Awright, just in case, I'd better get in fighting-fit<03e0>condition myself. Pops, I don't care what you give me,<03e0>but make it something to pump me up!
I'm not gonna move<07f0>even if you ask me to!<03e0>This's my favorite spot in town... I feel so close<03e0>to the Valeria Heart<07f0>it's almost like we're one.
I thought I could depend on those guys...<04e0>Shoulda just done it myself from the beginning.
But look how far I got on my own...<04e0>I guess... I guess I DO need other people's help...
Hmm? Dull face, silly outfit, slouched posture...<04e0>You there, you aren't Rush Sykes, are you?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yeah...why?<09e008e0010000000000>You're mistaken, old man.
Whaaat? Impudent little...<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
*snort* Playing dumb won't get you anywhere<07f0>if you're<03e0>playing at all.<04e0>Lord David put out a summons...he said he needed to<03e0>speak with you about something. Hurry to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0>.
Huh? Yeah...that's the face, that's the clothes...<04e0>You're Rush Sykes, right?<06e0000008e0000000000000>Yup, I'm Rush!<09e008e0010000000000>...No?
Thought so! I've got a message for you from Lord David.<04e0>He says he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>information-gathering, and that you should come to<03e0>the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> for details.<04e0>Got it?
Hahaha, you're a terrible actor, kid. Don't worry,<03e0>though<07f0>you're not in trouble...not with us at least.<03e0>Lord David's put out a summons for you.<04e0>Apparently he's come up with a good starting place for<03e0>your information-gathering, so he'd like you to come<03e0>to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> so he can share it with you.<04e0>Don't make him wait too long, okay, kid? Or else you<03e0>might end up in trouble with us after all... Just joking!
Ohh! That valiant form...<04e0>You must be Rush Sykes, are you not?<06e0000008e0000000000000>The one and only!<09e008e0010000000000>Depends on who's asking.
Well met!<03e0>David, Marquis of Athlum requests that you come<03e0>to <1be0ffbe34ff>Athlum Castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Ha ha ha, you are as mischievous as ever, I see!<03e0>I bring a message from Lord David. He requests that<03e0>you come to the <1be0ffbe34ff>castle<1ce0> at your nearest convenience.
Oh, hey there.<04e0>Not to be brusque, but I've got a few things to take<03e0>care of, if you'll excuse me.
Hey there, Rush. You know, I've got a little sister too.<03e0>She's livin' here in Athlum... It inn't so bad workin' all<03e0>the time, since I know she's here waitin' for me.<04e0>That's why I always buy little trinkets with my wages...<03e0>They're presents for her. I always keep my eye out for<03e0>things she might fancy.
I've got a little sister as well. She loves it when I bring<03e0>her presents from my travels, so I always make sure<03e0>to get her somethin' nice.
Ahh... Bein' back in the Square really takes me back<03e0>to when I was just a lad...<04e0>When I was young, I'd run in with a bad crowd, y'might<03e0>say. Spent my time picking fights, making trouble. Me an'<03e0>the gang would loaf around the square here for hours..<04e0>Heh, prolly sounds strange to wax poetic on bein' a<03e0>delinquent, eh? My folks died in the war...thinkin' back,<03e0>I guess I was lonely...any family would do.
When I was a lad, I was a right little hooligan, I was.<03e0>Spent my days picking fights an' starting trouble.<03e0>Now I get paid to stop trouble...heh.
Ahh, Rush. Can I talk to you for a minute?<03e0>Recently, my sis's been acting strange. I bring her<03e0>presents like always, and she doesn't seem to care.<04e0>I wonder... I reckon she still hasn't forgiven me...<04e0>...<04e0>I told you how I used to be a bit of a hooligan, right?<03e0>It's a bit more serious than that. 'Cause back then,<03e0>I did something really, truly bad.<04e0>Every day I'd go out running with the gang. My sis<03e0>was just a baby, but I'd leave her all alone at home.<03e0>And one day, the beastmen invaded...<04e0>I ran home as quick as a wink, but it was too late.<03e0>My sister was lying there, both her legs crushed.<04e0>The only responsibility I had in the world was to take<03e0>care of my sister, but when she really needed me, I<03e0>failed her... I might as well have cut off her legs myself.<04e0>After that I swore to get on the straight and narrow.<03e0>Started working as a mercenary to make a little money...<03e0>Hoped to buy things to make her life a little brighter.<04e0>I just don't seem to be makin' any progress. I'm at a<03e0>loss, Rush, I just don't know what to do...
The only thing I had left in the world was my sister,<03e0>but I wasn't even with her when she needed me...<03e0>I might as well have cut off her legs myself...
Oho, heya, Rush.<04e0>After we talked before, I visited my sister. Didn't have<03e0>the foggiest what to do or say to make amends, so I<03e0>ended up gabbing on about my travels and such.<04e0>Beautiful vistas, fearsome beasts, good friends...<03e0>You know, all the things what goes along with a<03e0>journey.<04e0>Figured I'd be borin' her, but I look up an' she's staring<03e0>at me, eyes are sparkling, all "finish the story!" You don't<03e0>know how long it's been since I'd seen her that happy...<04e0>That's when it hit me...I'd been going about it all wrong.<03e0>I'm trying to charm my sis with money and material<03e0>things... That's not what she wanted at all.<04e0>Thinking back, it's so obvious it's staring me in the face.<03e0>I can't help but feel like a bit of an ass...<04e0>Rush, might not sound like much, but I was finally able<03e0>to start making amends for what I've done.<04e0>So... How do I put this...<03e0>I'll be depending on you from now on.<03e0>She likes the stories with you in 'em the best, after all.
Hey there, Rush. How's it going?<04e0>I was telling my sister about our travels, and she<03e0>seems to have taken a liking to General Blocter...<04e0>Sure he's a good guy and all, but as her brother, I'm<03e0>not sure how I feel about that...
Sorry, dearie, I'm still setting up shop.<04e0>It's taking a long time to hear back from my suppliers...<03e0>Ahh, living in such a rural area makes it tough to keep<03e0>things stocked!
