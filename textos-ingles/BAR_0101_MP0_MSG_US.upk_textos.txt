Howdy there! It's been a long spell since we've had<03e0>anyone new come 'round these parts<07f0>'specially a<03e0>young buck like you.<04e0>Welcome to Baaluk, the belle of the west<07f0>or the end<03e0>of the world, 'pending on who you ask. This is the<03e01be0ffbe34ff>Grentze Commune<1ce0>, our main settlement.<04e0>We don't get too many visitors, so I'm sure everyone'll<03e0>be real happy to see you!

So we've had another traveler come through town<07f003e0>not a cutie like you, though! He said he came from some<03e0>con-grass whozawhatzit group?<04e0>He went on about his organization bein' updated, with<03e0>some new feller in charge, like it was some of my<03e0>business...<04e0>I didn't even know there were organizations like that, but<03e0>so long as he wasn't asking for any money, it didn't<03e0>bother me none.

Oh, it's you again, come back to visit. You'd better keep<03e0>on going through, hon. Somebody's done taken the<03e0>Brimuslabus, can you believe it?<04e0>The Brimuslabus's stood here for hundreds of years,<03e0>sealin' away an evil god.<04e0>Without the Remnant, that god'll be back...and all the<03e0>madder for it, I'll tell you what.<04e0>Our poor village, this's gonna be the end...
Hoo-wee, can ya believe it? We were saved from that<03e0>terrible disaster by Mr. Wyngale and his posse.<04e0>Phew, I didn't know what to do, I don't even know<03e0>how to start to thank him. I was prayin' to every god I<03e0>could think of!
[[6th level message]](after the Remnant is stolen)
I reckon you saw them giant spikes stickin' out of the<03e0>cliff down yonder. That's our Remnant, the Brimuslabus.<04e0>Town legend says there was some terrible monster<03e0>running wild, but the Imperator took the Remnant and<03e0>sealed it in that very spot.<04e0>'Course, that was hundreds of years ago... If'n there's<03e0>any truth to it, I sure ain't the one to tell. Only<03e0>half-believe it myself, actually.
The Brimuslabus is gone.<04e0>I'm worried<07f0>real worried.<03e0>Sure hope the town legend is nothing more<03e0>than a fancy bedtime story.
[[3rd level message]]
Oh, get this. Some fancy-pants messenger strolled in<03e0>from some far-off place. ...Reckon most everyplace is<03e0>pretty far-off from here, though.<04e0>Apparently those big city-types've been havin' themselves<03e0>a war or two, and lost all their Remnants, so, they sent a<03e0>guy to come sniffing 'round here for unbound ones.<04e0>You can bet I gave him the evil eye 'til he gave up on<03e0>tryin' to take the Brimuslabus, I tell you what.<04e0>The nerve of them city folk, comin' here to steal our<03e0>Remnant! They'd just let that varmint sealed by the<03e0>Imperator come back, huh?

I'll be a monkey's uncle. That story 'bout the demon and<03e0>the Imperator was the honest truth after all.<04e0>Damnation, 'til now we been able to drive off everyone<03e0>tryin' to get their hands on the Brimuslabus. How in<03e0>blazes did this happen?<04e0>Welp, ain't nothin' to be done about it now. I was raised<03e0>here by my pappy and him by his pappy before that. I'm<03e0>stayin' here 'til the end.
Hey, have ya heard?<03e0>Some terrible big beast showed up here, an' that sovani,<03e0>Wyngale, beat the tar out of it!<04e0>All this time I figgered he was just some crazy kook,<03e0>who'd have thunk he'd end up all o' our saviors?
[[6th level message]](after the Remnant is stolen)
A couple times a year, a caravan of traders rolls through.<03e0>They come selling all kinds of equipment and other<03e0>exotic stuff from the east.<04e0>Some o' them traders were saying there's s'posed to be<03e0>some huge cities, a couple times bigger than here, even.<04e0>Speaking plainly, I think they were just pulling my leg.<03e0>Like someplace that big could really exist, come on,<03e0>I'm no idiot!
[[2nd level message]]
Hoo-wee, was I surprised!<04e0>Some feller from the east<07f0>called himself an emissary<03e0>or somesuch<07f0>came all the way out here to Grentze<03e0>from the capital city, Elysion.<04e0>Seems the folks on the continent all got into some<03e0>fightin', and lost a bunch of their Remnants. Shame,<03e0>ain't it?<04e0>Anyhow, I guess the world's pretty big after all.<03e0>Kinda makes me wanna strike out and do some<03e0>explorin' myself!
[[4th level message]]
Whoa there, pardner! This ain't no place to be<03e0>lollygagging!<04e0>Didn't you know? The legendary beast what was<03e0>sealed around here's woken up!<04e0>There ain't nothin' left for this town, sure as<03e0>I'm standin' here<07f0>so I'm hoofing it out. Dunno<03e0>where I'm headin', but it can't be worse.
Hey, pardner<07f0>izzit true what they say, that the<03e0>varmint what was s'posed to destroy the village was<03e0>beaten?<04e0>I heard tell that square peg of a sovani what lived<03e0>here came in with his pals an' saved the village.<03e0>Pretty amazin', ain't it?<04e0>I was on the road outta town when I heard the<03e0>rumor, so I came back t' check it out.
See that sovani knight standin' over by the cliffs?<03e0>That's Mr. Wyngale.<04e0>Mama says he's protected Grentze for a long, long<03e0>time<07f0>even since before I was born!
[[2nd level message]]
Mr. Wyngale stands there every day and prays towards<03e0>the Brimuslabus.<04e0>Wonder if his arms get tired, standin' like that all the<03e0>time...<04e0>I'd go and switch off with him so he could rest, but I<03e0>haven't got but two arms...
[[4th level message]]
Mister, what're we gonna do?<04e0>The Brimuslabus is gone, and Mama says some real<03e0>scary monster's come out!<04e0>Mr. Wyngale'll be able to do somethin' about it...right?
Hey, mister, didja see? That scary monster ain't here no<03e0>more. Mr. Wyngale found it and whupped it but good!<03e0>He's just amazing!<04e0>When I grow up, I wanna be just like him!
I am Wyngale.<04e0>I've stood here for hundreds of years, watching over<03e0>the Remnant Brimuslabus and what it seals.
Foolish qsiti.<03e0>The Brimuslabus has not blessed this town.<04e0>Or perhaps, it has.<03e0>Perhaps it has prevented Him from awakening.<03e0>That would indeed be a blessing.<04e0>Hmph...
Huh?<03e0>What're you doing here, old lady?
Wha<07f0>excuse me?<03e0>Do I even know you?
Oh, oops.<03e0>Um, I thought you were someone else...
Hmph! Make sure you have the right<03e0>person next time!
S-sorry...
Hmph... I'll let it slide this time. Of course, that's on<03e0>the condition that there's never a second.
Calling someone "old lady" is rude and inconsiderate...<03e0>especially when they aren't old!
Hm? You again.
Uh.
You don't look happy to see me.
Uh, n-no, that's not true!<03e0>Say, ol<07f0>O beautiful young maid, what're you doing<03e0>around here?
Training.<03e0>In my family, it's a rite of passage to travel the world.
Huh... Sounds pretty tough.<03e0>Take care of yourself, okay?
...Ahh. Thank you.
You're not as inconsiderate as I thought.
You're looking well.
Heya, Ms. Young Maiden.
...Right. So, could you please not call me that?<03e0>It's rather bothersome, to be honest.
Well, it's not like I know your name.
Oh?
...
The name's Emmy.
Nice to meet you for real, finally. I'm<07f001e00be00ae0>
Rush. Rush Sykes.<03e0>Right?
Wha<07f0>? How did you know!?
I have my ways.
Take care, Rush.
What's the purpose of my training?<03e0>Well...a lot of things. But in general,<03e0>training the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.
What's the purpose of my training?<03e0>Well...a lot of things. But in general,<03e0>training the mind and spirit, I'd imagine.
You're still searching for your sister, aren't you?<03e0>I wish there was something I could do to help...
You're still searching for your sister, aren't you?<03e0>I wish there was something I could do to help...
Of course I keep in touch with my family.<03e0>That's how I know about you.
Of course I keep in touch with my family.<03e0>That's how I know about you.
I thought I'd done plenty of training, but I still can't<03e0>even light a candle to Mother... But there's no way<03e0>I'm giving up now.
I thought I'd done plenty of training, but I still can't<03e0>even light a candle to Mother... But there's no way<03e0>I'm giving up now.
Ohh, Rush.<04e0>Finally, I'm free.<03e0>Finally, the time has come when I can kill that man!
Who do I mean?<04e0>Who indeed? Could be anyone.<03e0>Could be someone you know very well...<03e0>Heheheheh...
Heheheheh...
I was chained to the Brimuslabus hundreds of years<03e0>ago... Back when the Imperator still ruled the world.<04e0>You don't believe me?<03e0>Heheheh...<04e0>The bastard was...unpleasant, to say the least.<03e0>I infuriated him because of my awesome strength<03e0>and the fact that he couldn't break my spirit.<04e0>So when he ran out of use for me, he forced me<03e0>to bind the Brimuslabus and act as the Fallen's seal.<04e0>What a pitiful man he was.<03e0>Heh heh heh...
Heh heh heh...
Rush...<04e0>It's...it's beginning to come back to me...<03e0>The person I was then...<04e0>Working with the Imperator, fighting for the Imperator.<03e0>Fighting all the time...<03e0>Anger...destruction...chaos...death...<04e0>It was so much fun.<03e0>The best days I've ever spent...<04e0>And then...that man...<03e0>The Imperator himself tried to snatch it all away!<03e0>But now...now we see who's truly won...<04e0>Muh...muh...mwa-hahahahaha!!!
Mwa-hahahahaha!!!
Before he left me here, he told me something...<03e0>"We'll meet again if the fates allow."<04e0>Heh heh heh...<04e0>I can feel it...feel it strongly.<03e0>The feel of his soul, not fully claimed by death...<04e0>Wait for me, spirit wandering the space between<03e0>heaven and earth. Wait, because I'm going to find<03e0>you and destroy you.<04e0>There won't even be a sliver of soul left when I'm<03e0>done with you!<04e0>Finally, you'll regret what you've done!<03e0>Bwah-hahahahahahah!!!
Rush! I feel amazing!<04e0>When you go to battle, make sure you tell me. Got it?<03e0>Don't you dare go without me!
Rush...<03e0>This time at last, all my bonds have been released...<03e0>But... I just don't understand this feeling of emptiness...
Heya, Rush.<04e0>Sorry I kinda tricked ya into helping Baaluk.<03e0>But I really appreciate the help, honest!
Hey! You're not still mad at me, are you? I know I went<03e0>about things the wrong way so we kinda got off on the<03e0>wrong foot...<04e0>B-but, anyway, from now on I'm totally committed to<03e0>doing anything to help out Baaluk! So go on, gimme an<03e0>order! I'm all ears!<04e0>I'm all ready to go, so just say the word!
I'm gonna help out as hard as I can!<03e0>Any time you wanna head out, just say the word!
Huh? Ah<07f0>R-Rush...<04e0>H-hey, how's it going, did you need something?<04e0>Hm? Something wrong<07f0>with me?<03e0>N-no, of course not! Not a bit! Ahahahah...<04e0>A-anyway, it's not time to go already, is it? If we've<03e0>still got some time, maybe you could give me a moment<03e0>alone...
H-hey, Rush. Is it time to go already?<03e0>If not, maybe you could leave me alone for a minute...
Rush...<03e0>I think...I've been tricked.<04e0>Maybe all of us have. And I think it's all my fault...<04e0>Yanno, the one who told me that the Brimuslabus was<03e0>about to Collapse was that guy Wyngale.<04e0>He's always been calm and serious, always acting with<03e0>the town's best interests at heart. But ever since they<03e0>took the Brimuslabus, it's like he totally changed...<04e0>Or maybe he's just showing his true colors. Maybe he<03e0>never cared about Baaluk at all in the first place...<04e0>And what's more, you know those guys we gave the<03e0>Remnant to? I have this really, really bad feeling about<03e0>them...<04e0>Oh man, what if all this time I've been acting high and<03e0>mighty, thinking I was the town's hero, when really I've<03e0>just been playing right into the bad guys's hands?<04e0>Augh, we don't even have a Remnant anymore! What's<03e0>going to happen to Baaluk now? ...I don't know what I'll<03e0>do if something awful happens...
What's going to happen to Baaluk now?<03e0>I don't know what I'll do if something awful happens...
There are towns that don't have Remnants?<03e0>And you're from one of them!?<03e0>Wow!<04e0>Then maybe Baaluk will be okay too!<03e0>Just maybe...<04e0>Thanks, Rush!<03e0>Thanks for telling me and giving me hope!<04e0>I said some awful things about Wyngale...<03e0>I don't know why I doubted him. I need to have<03e0>more faith in people and what they can do...<04e0>But now's not the time to dwell on the past.<03e0>It's time to turn Baaluk into a town everyone<03e0>wants to live in!
Okay, Rush, you've got me fired up!<04e0>I'm gonna work to make Baaluk a town everyone wants<03e0>to live in<07f0>even if it doesn't have a Remnant!
There's some power coming from the remains<03e0>of the Brimuslabus...something strong... I can't<03e0>believe this happened. I only wanted to help Baaluk...<04e0>...<04e0>Yeah... Maybe...this really is my fault.<03e0>And if so, I've gotta do something to help!<04e0>Rush<07f0>I've gotta bring back the Brimuslabus.<03e0>I mean, if everything's back to how it was before,<03e0>that's gotta make everything okay, right?<04e0>I know that you don't really have time to look into<03e0>what the Academy is doing, but what you are doing<03e0>doesn't seem that far off to me...<04e0>So...please, continue to let me fight with you.<03e0>Even if it's roundabout...I've gotta do something!
Rush!<03e0>Have you heard anything from the Academy?
What? Do you need something?
Something wrong?
Have you seen Lord David?<04e0>I do not feel comfortable letting him alone.<03e0>If you see him, please tell him I am looking for him.
Troublemaker...
...
On the surface, it does not seem like this place has<03e0>changed very much...<04e0>That said, it is no place to let Lord David run about<03e0>unsupervised. If you see him, tell him I am looking<03e0>for him.
You haven't seen Lord David?
If it was only going to be stolen anyway,<03e0>we should have taken the Remnant ourselves...<04e0>...No, Lord David would never have stood for it.
Please forget I said anything.
And we must assume the Conqueror is even<03e0>more powerful than that monster...
...
The Remnant Ark...<03e0>Surely there must be a similar Remnant elsewhere<03e0>in the world...
I can think of nothing...
Lord David is as prepared as he can be.<04e0>All I have to do is to follow.
Ahh...what a spectacular Remnant.<03e0>It just has a certain mystique, doesn't it?<03e0>I feel as if I'd never tire of looking at it...<04e0>However...it does look a bit like a pincushion,<03e0>doesn't it...
Incredible...
...
After learning of Remnants disappearing the world<03e0>over, I'd become a bit wary, but look. This place is the<03e0>same as always...it's a small but appreciated blessing.
Yes, yes.
Then, it's just like Athlum...<04e0>The whole mood of the town is different.
What in the world is going on?
I lived through it yet can hardly believe it...<04e0>To think that such a fiend existed in this world...!
...
It must exist, somewhere...
Let's continue to search.
Let's finish this...learn the true ending of this tale.
Come and check out the weapons they have!<03e0>Ahh, from blunt to sharp, fancy decorative stuff<03e0>to everyday weapons, I love 'em all!
Heheheheh...
Lady Emma...
Heya, Rush! Check it out<07f0>the Remnant's still alive<03e0>and kicking! So we can't get all down either, right?
We can't lose hope now!
Even the weapons seem kinda pooped out...<03e0>Guess it's 'coz the Remnant's gone...
Geez, even the weapons seem pooped out...
The heck was that all about?<04e0>Geez, at least we won.<03e0>Don't gotta worry about that thing anymore!
Don't gotta worry about that thing anymore!
If I have to think about this Remnant stuff any more,<03e0>my head's gonna explode! You just tell me where<03e0>to go when you've figured it out, okay?
I'm ready to rock whenever!
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>Don't worry<07f0>I'll knock down anybody in our way!
What am I doing?<04e0>Just as it looks, taking a walk. As the Marquis, I can't<03e0>just roam the streets alone in Athlum or Celapaleis...<04e0>I'm certain Torgal is having conniptions, but let's keep<03e0>this between us, shall we?
Remember<07f0>this is our secret.
This town's Remnant still stands.
...
Here as well...<04e0>It is not only Athlum that's lost its Remnant...
...
To think, something like that was sealed by the<03e0>Brimuslabus...<04e0>We're lucky nothing like that was sealed beneath<03e0>the Valeria Heart...
...
What am I rushing around for?<03e0>To be honest, I was mainly trying not to be recognized...
I hope we're not too late...
Let's go, Rush!<04e0>And we'll return together<07f0>victorious!
The town may look the same as always,<03e0>but that's only at first glance.<04e0>There's plenty of rumbling beneath the surface...<03e0>This is no time to start slacking.
This place is rotten...
They've lost their Remnant as well...<03e0>I suppose it could be just coincidence...<04e0>Certainly seems like a plot, though...
I can't believe someone isn't behind all this...
Good god... A Remnant powerful enough to seal a<03e0>beast like that<07f0>what kind of being was able to handle<03e0>that sort of power?
...
Hey now, quit playing around and help us search, will<03e0>you? There's got to be another way to get to the<03e0>Sacred Lands, but we won't find it if you don't look.
Don't worry<07f0>we'll find it.
I'll look after Lord David since she cannot...<03e0>So you'd better do the same for Irina.
